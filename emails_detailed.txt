Hey All,

Krupp's chairs and garden tables have been going on to the football pitch for the ICFT games (which is alright) but have not been coming back (which is not good!). It would be great if you could return them back to where they belong as soon as the games are done. It's getting a bit annoying having to walk across the Krupp terrace to enjoy a meal in the sun.

I would urge especially the ICFT organizers to be a bit more responsible!

Have a nice weekend.

Regards,

Warren

==== email_text: 
Dear Jacobs Students,****

**Since I started as President of Jacobs University I have had the great
honor to be a guest at many of your events on and off campus.

I just like to use this opportunity to let you all know what a great
pleasure it=92s been and how impressed and proud I was to listen to the
J-Cappella and Mzuka choirs, watch the manifold great performances during
Spotlight, see the rowing teams battle it out with the HSBA in Hamburg, witness
the first classical lunchtime concerts or just recently to enjoy the
awesome musical theatre production =93The Jacobs Way=94 =96 to name but a few.
The goose bumps were uncountable (a mathematical expression)!
As much as my time permits I am hoping to be part of many more of your
fantastic campus events in the years to come.

Culture in all its facets - let it be music, dancing, theatre, sports =96 is
one of my most enjoyable pastimes and I feel incredibly lucky to be the
President of a university where students are so incredibly committed and
involved in shaping the social and cultural life on campus.

I can honestly say that in all my academic life at different national and
international universities I have never seen such exceptional student
involvement.

Let me thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the great cultural
experiences so far. You helped me in a big way to feel home at Jacobs.

I very much look forward to being a guest at many more brilliant communal
events.

**

Heinz-Otto

If you have any questions, feel free to refer to the guidelines:

==== email_text: 

Dear Community,

The Nordmetal single room phase is now open.
Kindly NOTE that all prior applications were cancelled and therefore if you want a single room next year you must reapply now.
The allocation is based first on points, then on chance (depending on if two people of equal points apply for the same room).
There are more rooms now available for allocation but please note that if you are allocated to the 3rd floor in A block, there is the possibility of being moved to the corresponding room on 4th floor, depending on the decision made by the administration on graduate student housing.

This round shall be open till tonight 14-05-13 at 23:59.

Please log in once more before the round ends to ensure that your changes have been saved.

Use your campusnet credentials and log into:

If you have any questions, feel free to refer to the guidelines:

http://usg.jacobs-university.de/legal-foundation/haus.html

or consult a member of the Housing and Facilities committee.

Kind regards,

Robin.

Group present their projects on statistically analyzing a data stream (e.g.
DNA sequencing, internet traffic, survey data on different cultures) and
creatively manipulating it using algorithms and filters to generate a
sound/music composition.

*Sonification* is used to gain insight into periodicities and patterns
within the data itself, thus opening up an alternative method to
understanding data or information, and even reveal formerly hidden
structures and meaning.

Please join us:

==== email_text: 
Dear Nordies,

I know you are busy with finals and plans for the summer and the Welcome Back Dinner in fall seems far away. But time is flying  and I would like to call for live performers to indicate their interest in performing at the dinner now.

We will have up to 150 freshmen coming to Nordmetall and should not only give them a warm welcome, but inspire and amaze them by putting together a fabulous show at the Welcome Back Dinner, beginning of September.

If you sign up now, you'll have the whole summer to practice or prepare (song, instrumental, juggling, dance, pantomime, magic tricks etc.) and this gives the Team the chance to put your names on the posters. Don't be shy, I know there is amazing talent out there. Let's dazzle the Freshmen and put a smile on everyone else's face at the dinner.


Hope to hear from you!

I have misplaced my keys somewhere from East Hall to c3.

They have lots of keychains, and there's a bullet and a white Beatles keychain, and a Turkish evil eye thing on them that's a little bit chipped.

If you find them please let me know!

THANK YOU.

==== email_text: 
Dear Students,

It is that time of the year again when your views and reviews regarding your courses truly matter. Yes, we are talking about the Teaching Evaluations! They have been released and it is vital for you to fill them out to enable your Professors to know which aspects of their course were good and which were not.

It is the goal of the Academic Affairs Committee (AAC) to ensure that most (if not all) Professors respond to your evaluations and in order to make that happen, you ought to fill out the evaluations on CampusNet.

We would like to take this opportunity to inform you that if there are critical issues that you believe need to be addressed with regards to specific courses/majors, then kindly have a look at the focal points (AAC committee members) who are solely responsible for a particular major. You can contact them directly to express your concerns which would then be escalated to the Major Co-ordinators.

Hello,

I am giving away for free the following two items described and pictured below:

IKEA Lack Coffee Table
<8750594366_2ee0660c08_m.jpg><http://www.flickr.com/photos/cosmostar/8750594366/in/set-72157633524615790/lightbox/> <8750594072_5a827be928_m.jpg><http://www.flickr.com/photos/cosmostar/8750594072/in/set-72157633524615790/lightbox/> <8749470825_c5ccd12ecb_m.jpg><http://www.flickr.com/photos/cosmostar/8749470825/in/set-72157633524615790/lightbox/>

The IKEA coffee table comes from the Lack series. It is lightly used and in pretty good condition. We have no need for it any longer and so hope one of you will want it. It is 118 cm (L) x 78 cm (W) x 45 cm (H) in size, so it should fit most rooms nicely.

Bedside/TV Table with Drawers:
<8749471731_28792e32ab_m.jpg><http://www.flickr.com/photos/cosmostar/8749471731/in/set-72157633524615790/lightbox/> <8750594536_658b05e2fa_m.jpg><http://www.flickr.com/photos/cosmostar/8750594536/in/set-72157633524615790/lightbox/>

This table with drawers can be used as a bedside or TV table. You can also use it as a side table for sofas. It is 60cm (L) x 30cm (W) x 57cm (H) in size.

First one to want the item(s) gets them.

==== email_text: 
Or do you just have a lot of space you need filled?
I'm selling two couches that work perfect for the living room of the
apartments ( perfect fit under the window).
One of them splits into 4 pieces and you can arrange however you want (4
seater, 1+3 seater, two 2 seaters etc.).
There's also a fridge with a freezer compartment you might wanna check out.
Come see them MA202/3 or reply for price offers and questions.

==== email_text: 
Dear all,

This is to inform you that the Ultimate Frisbee tournament (ICUFT) scheduled for tomorrow will take place as planned. This decision was made after consulting with the C3 CMs, and we hope that this tournament could provide an opportunity to get one's mind off things, to enjoy some physical exercise and (hopefully) to enjoy some sunny Bremen weather. Everyone is (of course) welcome to come watch and relax.

As I have pointed out in previous emails, this tournament is open for everyone of any skill level. We will show you how to throw and play.

We will divide into teams (5-6 per team) when we meet on the field at 11am (unless you made a team already). However, if you cannot make it that early, we'll put you in a team when you show up.

As this is a very weather-dependent event it is difficult to schedule games and say things for sure. However, we will play as long as there is interest.

Please note: as the signs on the field are indicating, you may not step on the grass. However, as this event is scheduled with CampusLife ahead of time, we may use it for this time period. So no frisbee (or anything else) on the field before the event or after the event. Sorry.

Hope to see you there,
With best regards,
B=E5rd

==== email_text: 
Dear community,

You may now log in to the program and choose which ROOM in the apartment you would like.

For Example Nadja and Robin got allocated to MA328/329 but Robin wants MA 328(left room) and Nadja MA 329(right room). Same applies for triples.

AS usual- Use your campusnet credentials and log into:

http://jacobs.code4fun.de/

This shall be open till tonight Mon 20-5-13 at 23:59.

Additionally if your roommate and yourself mutually agree that you want to switch rooms with another roommate pair,
send us an email with all parties in cc, and we shall switch you.=20

eg. Robin and Nadja got allocated to MA328/329,
     Octavian and Jan got allocated to MA202/203
     And they both agree to switch, i.e
     Robin and Nadja get MA202/203 and Octavian and Jan get MA328/329.

Kindly Note this is only between pairs in the SAME COLLEGE!

This shall only be possible till tonight Mon 20-5-13 at 23:59.

If you have any questions, feel free to refer to the guidelines:

http://usg.jacobs-university.de/legal-foundation/haus.html

or consult a member of the Housing and Facilities committee.

Best regards,

Robin.

==== subject: [jacobs-students-announce] OFFICIAL save this mail: what if sick?
==== email_text: 
Dear Students,

The finals will start, at this occasion I would like to inform you how to deal with the medical excuses in case of sickness.
You will find academic policy regarding excuses from academic obligations it at:  http://www.jacobs-university.de/policies-undergraduate-classroom#7.5_Excuse_from_Academic_Obligations

Students will not be excused from taking any kind of examination or from attending mandatory class/lab sessions for reasons other than ill health or personal emergency.  You must inform the Instructor of Record before the beginning of the examination or class/lab session.

Illness must be documented in writing by a qualified physician (the doctor=B4s note is called "Arbeitsunf=E4higkeitsbescheiningung".)
Other emergencies must be appropriately documented in writing.
All such documentation must be placed on file in the Office of the Registrar by no later than the third calendar day from the beginning of illness/of the emergency.

The first day that counts is the earliest date on the medical excuse, i.e. if you are excused starting from 12.05., you should provide us the excuse by 14.05. at the latest to be officially excused from the Registrar's department.
Backdated excuses will not be accepted, i.e. if you go to the doctor on 12.05. and get an excuse from 08.05. until 09.05. and same proceeding with excuses that "announce" a sickness for the next day will not be accepted, i.e.  if you go to the doctor on 12.05. and get an excuse from 13.05. until 14.05.

Please also note that you will need to contact the respective professor(s) immediately for a make-up appointment.
Only if these conditions are fulfilled you are given a chance for a make-up exam.

Finally, one last request:
Very important: do not forget to write the instructor's names on the note (not the courses).
Due to the strong accumulation of medical excuses that we receive without professor's names written on the note, these notes will not be processed prior until we get the needed information.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Good luck on your finals!

Kind regards,
Savitri da Cruz

However, I shall remind you that we all are going through he same tension and stress. 76 people from different majors are taking this course, and knowing that we were not lucky enough to get an amazing TA(like the one you are having in ESM 2B - Rustam) we unfortunately had to self-organize. I thank you for your understanding and your solidarity and I wish you the best of luck in your exams.

Hello lovely Jacobs people!

I have a favour to ask and I really hope someone can help me.

Is there anyone who has a check out appointment on June 10th (doesn't matter which time) and would be willing to switch it with me? I currently have my appointment on June 9th at 7 pm.

I was planning on checking out on June 10th and my parents are coming to help me move out, so I really would need to stay until then. Also I'm not going home directly, but I have to stay at someone else's place for a few nights after that and I really don't want to ask them for another night.
SO, pleeeease, if someone would switch with me, I would be eternally eternally grateful (yes twice, that's not a typo - that's how grateful I would be)!


Thank you so much in advance and sorry for the spam!

Best,
Inga

Dear Nordies,

If you own a bike and want to leave it over the summer in front of the College or in our bike cellar in Research V you have to label it. You can pick up the special labels in the College Office during our office hours.

Any unlabeled bikes will be removed (if need be chains will be snapped) from in front of the college or the bike cellar over the summer by Facilities. If you forget to label your bike and don't claim it with Facilities in very early September it will be disposed of permanently.

So don't forget to label your bike(only with the CO labels)  before you leave and to be on the safe side store it our Bike Celler ! :D

Best,

Stefan on behalf of the College Office Team

==== email_text: 
.... then candidate for the Young Learner (YL) position!

What is the YL?
The YL is a member of the Academic Board (AB) which meets every 4 weeks to discuss academic matters. He/she directly represents the student opinion of Bachelor and Master students. Other members of the AB are: the Provost, the 5 Deans, the Directors of the SES and SHSS and of the Academic Affairs Office, and the Young Scholar (representing PhD students and Staff).

What does the Academic Board discuss?
Topics include mainly program curricula, de-/installment of majors, decisions about hiring/replacement of teaching personnel, and decisions regarding academic policy. In the next academic year, the AB should also finalize constitutional changes and refine the tasks of certain positions and committees in the Academic Rules of Procedure.

Currently, I am the Young Learner but we will elect a new one before the summer break. If you think about candidating but have questions, you are welcome to approach me via email, phone (5381) or personally. I will also offer an information setting (time and location will be announced) soon.

Why should you become the YL?
If you are interested in developing the academic structures at Jacobs and if you would like to represent the student body, this is your opportunity. You will also be able to work together with the USG and GSA and get to know Jacobs' structures and politics much better.

Think about it! :)

Best,
Nadja

Dear all,

I seem to have misplaced my camera: silver, Panasonic Lumix

I had it last on Saturday night in the NM common room, next to the TV.

So in case, you found it or for some reason took it I would be more than greatful if you could give it back.

You can also just put it in a plastic bag and leave it in front of my door NC-311.


Best,

Luise

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] Important Information about Room Checkouts
==== email_text: 
Dear Community,



We would like to thank everyone who participated in the survey concerning room checkouts at the beginning of this academic year.

As room checkouts are approaching, we want to inform you about the following:



1. We formed a taskforce with the University Housing and Facility committee and the outcomes are the following:

  *   A new check-out form that clearly marks what you will be charged for or not: http://ribare.de/protocol.pdf

  *   A new FAQ page to answer any questions that you might have is available here : http://ribare.de/faq.php<http://ribare.de/faq.phf>

2. We have talked to the relevant authorities to ensure that the checkout staff is well trained and will be as transparent as possible.

3. If there are any damages in your current room, make sure to get them repaired NOW, as it is free of charge. Simply fill in the following facility request:

https://www.jacobs-university.de/housing/facility-request-form or you'll be charged during your checkout.


The list of charges is available here: http://checkout.jacobs-university.de/pricelist.pdf



4. Furthermore, it is important to store your valuables in the lockers during checkouts. Any furniture for disposal should be taken to the big containers outside the colleges and NOT left on the corridors.

   There are clothes recycling bins across the street from Taunusstrasse, if you want to get rid of clothes.


5. The housing committee does NOT handle check out appointments, any queries should be directed to checkout@jacobs-university.de<mailto:checkout@jacobs-university.de>


Best,
Lava
On behalf of the Housing and Facilities Committee

==== email_text: 
Since a number of people asked me:

Today at 15:00 in Vegesack (across the bus stop, next to the D=F6ner kebap place) is arguably the last chance to see the Jacobs male football team in action for a home game this season. This is not ICFT :) we will play no matter the weather and yes, there are a number of seats from where you can watch and the rain (if any) can't touch you. Today we play against TUS Schwachhausen who are ranked pretty high in our league so it will be a good game to watch. :) Come and support us after your Stats, CS or Chemistry finals today, it will free your mind for the next exam! :)

If you miss this chance, our really last home game is on June 8 at 17:00 (the day after the graduation) if you are still here.

Best wishes,

Marius-Febi

They have three amazing saunas, a big fitness area and a lot of fun classes both during the week and weekends.
You can get more info and pictures here: http://www.ulc-bremen.de/clubs/fitness-company-nord/startseite.html
Membership fee for students is 40 Euros per month, including drinks (flavored water, but not coffee or special stuff) and all classes you want, as well as the sauna.
The team knows English; there is even a Spanish speaking trainer there :)

Hit reply if you are interested.
cheers
Mirjam

Dear Mark, 

 

The word length of an essay is traditionally given in the hexadecimal system
on Campusnet. Therefore 500=5*16^2=1280 and 700=7*16^2=1792. Thus you should
write an essay of around 1500 words. Of course, you can make it more if that
is still not enough for you. 

 

Best, 

Robert

Dear Duc,

Yes, indeed. I think my good friend and colleague Robert has done some considerable research prior to the statement of this fact. I might even add that from time to time you have to calculate the digit sum of the ascertained wordcount. In this case this would narrow down the eventual amount of words to be written as follows:
1280=11 and furthermore 1792=19. According to this staggering piece of mathematical magic you might end up writing 22 words and be above word limit. But do not despair, my inquisitive Padawan, a brew of mashed frog hearts, boiled frankincense and a moderately dosed shot of Slovakian codliver oil in combination with a recitation of the ancient words "Oh God, why?" will remedy all your worries. 

Yours sincerely,
Jan-David III

Hey guys I'm not sure where you're getting your information from, but the
word counts at Jacobs are given in a plain format without a further need
for calculation. Both of you are pretty off in both extremes which should
have tipped you off from the beginning. On one hand, a word count like 1792
is arbitrary and too specific  on the other hand a word count like 11 is an
interesting concept but not anything a serious instructor would give.

just wanted to clear things up,

I need print the passport-size photo from the digital version which I have, I need it by tomorrow night.
Does anybody know where I can do it for reasonable price (I know 1 photo-salon, but there it costs almost 25 euro...), or maybe somebody on campus can do it (for money, of course) ?

Sorry for spam.

Dear Ukrainians of the Bubble,
(and people like me, leaving fairly close to Ukraine :D),

Is anyone by any chance flying to Kiev on 4th of June from Hamburg (WizzAir flight)?
It's utterly boring (and shady) to chill during night at Hamburg Hbf (which we have to do to catch the shuttle bus) and I would be grateful for any company :)

Let me know!

It is a rather large rectangular piece, has no embroidery, is of an uniform light blue-turquoise colour (lighter than this) and I miss it very much!! Especially since I'm leaving very very soon.
Please tell me if you have seen it - I need it desperately!
;)

It lookes somewhat like this (colour), but that is NOT it. If you have found it, please give it back...

==== email_text: 
To all Non-Germans Girls on campus,

If you have no summer plans yet and want to say in Germany , I know a very nice family living in a suburb of Hannover  that is looking for a nanny to stay with their kids for June-July-August .
They have 3 very charming and calm kids ( I know them personally ) .

 You would have to :
Look after their kids from Monday till Friday during the working hours of the mother. ( from 9 till 15:00 )  but you get free weekends.
The period of work would be June 15 th till End of august ( but this should be further discussed with the family if interested ).
Perform very light workhouse ( ironing , washing dishes FROM TIME to TIME )
Care about the kids , play with them etc.


In exchange :
You Dive into German Culture.
You get to speak German in germany !
You get free Room and Board
Family pays for your transportation
Family gives your a monthly allowance of (250-300 euros )
Health Insurance is partly paid ( to be discussed with the family)
You are considered as part of the family.
Family HAS to allow you to take your German courses 3 times a week.

I was supposed to be with them but I had a change of plan and now they are looking for someone trustworthy. If interested, get back to me !

I read that the Nachsendeauftrag allows you to have stuff being sent to your mailbox forwarded to a temporary location at which you might be staying in the summer.

Has anyone of you set the Nachsendeauftrag up? How did you do for setting it for 3 months or the amount of time you need? I only encounter two fixed options, which are 6 and 12 months.

Any help would be truly appreciated :)

I am selling the Official Guide for GMAT Review, 12th (and newest) Edition. It is absolutely new, I bought it in September thinking that I might need it to study for GMAT, but I eventually changed my mind and didn't take the exam anymore so the book hasn't even been touched.

You should definitely get this if you are planning to go for business school. It costs 35 EUR on Amazon http://www.amazon.de/The-Official-Guide-GMAT-Review/dp/0470744510/ref=3Dsr_1_6?ie=3DUTF8&qid=3D1370287502&sr=3D8-6&keywords=3Dgmat

My price: 25 EUR, you really couldn't get a better deal :D

Get back to me if interested.

==== email_text: 
Hi Graduating Jacobs CS Folks!

Not too long ago (atleast I=C2=B4d like to think) - I was where you are right
now - a few days away from graduating - and not really sure of what I was
going to do next.  So here=C2=B4s an offer to help make life easier :)

My company - Accenture - is recruiting strongly at the moment. Its an IT &
Business Consultancy.  They are keen on German speakers (for positions in
Germany) - but if you=C2=B4re good - (especially on the technical side) - you
can land a pretty sweet position in the Technical Consulting parts as well.
 Its a great place to work at - especially for someone with an
international background - and I can strongly recommend it.

So if you=C2=B4re interested - you need to do 2 things -
1) go to the Accenture Careers page - and find positions that you are
interested in - make a list of your top 5 choices
2) Send me the above list - and a well written CV

I=C2=B4ll get back to you with follow up questions and if its a fit - recommend
you directly internally to the right people.

If you have questions and to send me your CV - mituljain@gmail.com

Good luck and congratulations on having survived Jacobs ;)

Cheers,
Mitul

Class of 2013,

It's quite clear our choices.... (were terrible) left a lot to be desired. If you hated them both and want to see this changed, please come sign the petition at the place where you can pick up your gowns and tickets now!


Since this is so last minute and the music needs to turned over in a few hours, I am recommending we change the music to something traditional since we don't have time to fight over this.

The recommendation is the traditional "Pomp and Circumstance", you can listen here:

In front of NC-310 you can find all sorts of EECS and Physics related books, maybe even maths or other topics:)

There are also some beautiful posters that you can put up in your room after the summer!

==== subject: Re: [nordmetall-students] [krupp-students] White Paint?
==== email_text: 
last year i used white paint to cover up the bits of paint that came off my
wall.
the guy who inspects noticed as the white was a slightly different colour
(who knew you could have several kinds of whites). anyway he said that by
painting over the pealed paint, that its actually more costly for the
university to fix... the original paint can all be pealed off so if they
wanted to repaint it its easier. the extra paint i added would just leave
lumps now..

so really i know everyone is looking for white paint, but be careful. you
might end up making it worse like i did :\

Hello All,

There will be badminton during the summer vacation from Wednesday June 
19th till, the 28th of June in the Sports Hall.
After that, they are doing some construction work till August 7th.
Unfortunately, the university will not provide any equipment this 
summer, so you have to bring your own rackets and shuttle(or take a 
chance and hope that people have 2 or more rackets).
So, if you are interested please reply, and I'll make a mailing list so 
that other people are not spammed every day.

search paradigms with simultaneous tactile stimulation. Throughout the
duration of the study neurophysiological recordings will be taken through
the use of an EEG. Eye movements will also be recorded with the use of an
eye tracking system. This study will take approximately 2 hours to
complete. As I am only looking for 20 subjects it will be first come first
serve. If you are interested in this study, or have any questions regarding
this study please do not hesitate to ask. Please respond to this email in a
separate email.

Thank you,

==== subject: [EECS-undergrads] Looking for CTO and Developers for early-stage
==== email_text: 
Are you interested in working for an early stage startup in one of the
coolest cities in the world? Perfect! After graduating from Brown
University, I just finished collecting a pre-seed round for an innovative
social-media startup that is still in Stealth Mode. My startup team is
looking for developers experienced in App or Website development that know
their way around Ruby or PHP or iOS.  If you have worked with social
networks before, it=92s a big plus, but not necessary, as we like to attract
anybody that can adapt and take on new challenges.

Why should you apply? 3 reasons: 1.) You get to create an innovative social
media product from the ground up that will scale all around the world!!!
2.) We do not just offer money, but also significant equity, so that you
directly profit from the financial upside. 3.) If you have been to Berlin
before, you know that it is one of the must international, buzzing cities
in the world. I assure you, Berlin is tons of fun, super cheap to live in
and you don=92t need to know a word of German to get around.

Importance: high

Deadline: November 27   - December  6, 2013
************************************************************************************************************
Dear Students ,
The Teaching and Course Evaluation will be open as of today, November 27, 2013.  You will find the evaluation in Campus.Net under the Menu Item Course Evaluation/Course Evaluation and will have time to evaluate your classes December 6, 2013.
We have asked your instructors to arrange about 10 minutes in one of the last classes during which you may fill in the evaluation. Please bring your laptop to the respective session, so that you are technically prepared.
Please note that we are very interested in a high return rate of the Teaching and Course Evaluation in order to be able to improve the teaching at Jacobs University. Only if we get as much feedback as possible we have reliable data to use for the necessary improvements. Therefore, please complete an evaluation for each of the courses you were taking this semester.
Thank you for your cooperation!
Heike Bohne

==== email_text: 
Dear Nordies,

you have probably all noticed that cute red cat which seems to love us so much that it basically lives under the colums...
I don't know why it came here and whom it belongs to (if you have any clue please let me know!), I just have a little request to you all:

PLEASE STOP FEEDING THE CAT!!!

First of all, servery food (in general and especially in uncontrolled amounts) is NOT any good for cats
and secondly, if we stop feeding it, it will probably go back to its owner, who hopefully cares about it and stops being in desperate search for his cat...
So, cuddle it and play with it as much as you like but please stop the feeding!

Thank you!!
Kara

==== email_text: 
Dear Jacobs Community!

the "Tuwas-Caf=E9" (literally: "Do something caf=E9") offers free consultation services and leisure time activities for refugees in Bremen-Vegesack.

In order to do so they are

looking for international volunteers with language skills in Arabic, Kurdish, Russian, Persian and Turkish.

They are open on Thursdays from 1 - 3:30 pm and are located in the Alte Hafenstrasse 68/69.

The caf=E9 is part of the "TUWAS - f=FCr Fl=FCchtlinge in Bremen" ("Do something - for refugees in Bremen") project and is supporting refugees who are looking for a place to stay or help with connecting them to relevant agencies. Furthermore, they are developing a range of leisure time activities such as painting.

If you would like to become part of this project and help them out, please drop by the caf=E9 or write an email to

Jana Piotrowski
AWO Bremen-Soziale Dienste
j.piotrowski@awo-bremen.de

It would be awesome if some of us could support this caf=E9 and be a part of the local community in this way, so don=B4t be shy =3D)

DEADLINE EXTENSION!

Dear students,

Due to the fact that the finals occupy most of your time I have decided to extend the deadline for submitting the video clips to JANUARY 31, 2014.

Another note: this Thursday, a very interesting person is visiting Jacobs University. It is Dr. Ijad Madisch, the founder and CEO of Research Gate, the "Facebook for Scientists". His story of success is truly amazing, as he has started with just an idea, and is now running the most successful company in this area. Among others, Bill Gates is supporting him. Look here<http://jacobs-university.de/2013/12/dr-ijad-madisch-making-researchgate-idea-disruptive-technology> for details.

I hope to see many of you!

Regards,

Dear Students,

If you want to upload your clip via YouTube, and if the clip contains copyright protected music (irrespective of the length!!) you MUST obtain the permission of the copyright holder BEFORE you upload the clip.

Here is a useful link: https://www.gema.de/en/press/popular-subjects/youtube.html

You can look for the copyright holder in a database here: https://online.gema.de/werke/?lan=3Den

I would advise you NOT to include copyright-protected stuff for including them in the clips.

Thanks for your consideration.

Happy clipping!

Dear Nordies,

there will be a rather hefty storm today and possibly tomorrow. The strong
winds may damage the doors of the college. Therefore, please keep the doors
between the floors shut today, and, most importantly, check that the doors
to the outside are closed once you leave/enter the building. The automatic
shutters are likely not to work with such strong winds.

Hope the storm will be over tomorrow, so that we can all enjoy the Xmas
market
All the best

Please help Santa to transport some goods for the lovely Christmas market in H3.

The setting up begins at 3 PM today so it would be awesome if a very kind person could borrow a car (and of course tag along if necessary) before that..

I know that with the s**** weather the chances are very low and that is why it is even more appreciated if there is a very kind person out there.

Eternal gratitude and reimbursement included.

Dear Jacobians,

We are re-opening a handful of time slots for our experiment next week. Come Participate in a Great Experiment!! Watch funny film clips and judge them using an Affective Grid. You can earn 6 Euros for your participation.

We are running a 45 minute experiment titled =93Input Parameter & Affect-Grid Study 2013=94. This experiment tests a tool called =93Affect Grid=94 as an input device for your responses about how much you enjoy the film clips. In addition we are going to measure bodily responses with the help of a few sensors attached to your face.

Experiment takes place in Lab 3, the lab opposite Research 4 (one with the brain). Please be sure to arrive on time and ensure that you can make the time slot before signing up. We look forward to seeing you.

Spaces are limited to availability. If the poll does not allow you to pick a time, it means that the poll is full.

1. Sign up here: http://www.doodle.com/tdtpn9yqkd2m5q3n  (please sign up using your full name)

2. You will receive a confirmation email if you've signed up successfully

==== email_text: 
I had a feeling today, going back through my past, and thinking about all my experiences since I came to Jacobs. And I just would like to say THANK YOU! It is amazing how for granted we take the stuff that happen here. It is a completely different world, and a connection that at times feels superficial but that at the same time builds you up. Please think about how you used to be before comming here, and who you would be now if you would study at a different University. I am thankful for all the people that I've met here, not only my friends - because each interaction with somebody opens your eyes a bit more. I am so happy to notice that people here are not friends based on what clothes you wear, who are your parents and which clubs do you go. People here learn to look beyond the society-constructed labels. At least most of the people I've interacted with. I am grateful to have experienced  how warm and helpful people can be with each other when they are comfortable enough to take their masks off. And this is what happens each day here. You live in a big House, going to dinner you meet the other people, you see each other in the worst states -after a hangover at the Sunday brunch, in the IRC sleepless during exam period, at parties all dressed up- so you get comfortable and real. I just wanted to remind you of the beauty of this place and some small things that you might take for granted. I bet in a normal University, you'd get to meet only the socially adequate side of the people.. and that is by far not as refreshing as living in this place.

With this love in my heart, I want to wish you strength and good luck if you're still studying for your exams, and a wonderful Winter Vacation with lots of snow, Christmas movies, and Laughs!

It's cold outside and  you need warm cloths. That's what you will find in the Little Fashion Shop in a nice and big variety.

Please find the link at the CSC-Website: http://www.jacobs-university.de/career-services/internship-reports . Please note that once you follow the link, you must log on with your CampusNet credentials.

You may contact respective students who completed their internships for more information. We would herewith like to encourage the student community for more networking concerning internship and job search.

PLEASE NOTE: We uploaded only so far approved reports with permission of the respective student. Stay tuned for more uploads (e.g. additional Logistics reports approx. in Feb/Mar 2014 due to internship duration and late reporting deadlines).

PLEASE NOTE: This is not official information about student's internship status. We will soon send an official email about the internship status of students who completed their internship in 2013 to each student.

If you have any questions or remarks, please contact Ms. Petra Zarrath (p.zarrath@jacobs-university.de<mailto:p.zarrath@jacobs-university.de>).

2.     Please return all furniture and soft furnishings you 'borrowed' to common rooms.

3.     Store your bike at Research V to be on the safe side. (Bikes in the basement aisles will be removed during the break.)

4.     Please take all apetito property  (trays, china, glasses and cutlery) down to the servery.

5.     Clean your room and take down trash to the dumpsters.

6.     Leave your plants with a friend or take them to the College Office, the Team will water them.

And last but not least, air your room, close the window and turn down the heating before you go!

If I don't see you before you leave, I wish you a safe trip and great break! Merry Christmas to those who celebrate it!

==== subject: [jacobs-students-announce] OFFICIAL Save this mail: What if sick?
==== email_text: 
Dear Students,

The finals are running, at this occasion I would like to inform you how to deal with the medical excuses in case of sickness.
You will find the academic policy regarding excuses from academic obligations it at:  http://www.jacobs-university.de/policies-undergraduate-classroom#7.5_Excuse_from_Academic_Obligations

Students will not be excused from taking any kind of examination or from attending mandatory class/lab sessions for reasons other than sickness, health or personal emergency.  They must inform the Instructor of Record before the beginning of the examination or class/lab session. The day after the excuse ends, students must contact the Instructor of Record in order to clarify the make-up procedure.

Illness must be documented in writing by a qualified physician (the doctor=B4s note is called "Arbeitsunf=E4higkeitsbescheiningung"). Other emergencies must be appropriately documented in writing.
All such documentation must be placed on file in the Office of the Registrar by no later than the third calendar day from the beginning of illness/of the emergency.
These three days include the first day of the illness / of the emergency, i..e. if you are excused starting from 12.12., you should provide us the excuse by 14.12. at the latest to be officially excused from the Registrar's department.
If you submit a sick certificate after the deadline, an excuse may be issued, when applicable, only for the submission date and the two calendar days preceding it. Predated or backdated sick certificates - i.e., when the visit to the physician takes place outside of the documented sickness period - will be accepted only when the visit to the physician precedes or follows the period of illness by no more than one calendar day.

Only if these conditions are fulfilled you are given a chance for a make-up exam.

Finally, kindly fulfill one last request which is very important:
Do not forget to write the instructor's names on the note (not the courses).. Due to the strong accumulation of medical excuses that we receive without professor's names written on the note, these notes will not be processed prior until we get the needed information.

Many thanks for your cooperation.
I wish you good luck on your finals and a wonderful Christmas Break!

Kind regards,
Savitri da Cruz

Dear all,

I am selling the Official IELTS Practice Material Volume 2. I did not write into the book, only copied some pages, thus it is in a very good condition! Also, it includes a DVD that helps to prepare for the speaking and listening part.

It's original price is 35 =80 (as you can see here:http://www.123contactform.com/form-578788/Order-Form-IELTS-PMs).

I am selling this book for 20 =80 which is less than 60% of its original price. The book is extremely helpful to pass the exam with your desired score as its sample tasks are close to the actual type of questions.

Answer this email or call 5078 if you want to buy this book!

All the best,
Jessica

Dear community,

3 weeks ago, my roomie made me a birthday cake and brought the cake tin, a cake shovel, and a knife from home. After I had cleaned them in the College 3 E-floor kitchen and let them dry there, the cake shovel and knife disappeared.

All three of these utensils came from my roomie's mum's kitchen equipment and are of great importance and high personal value to her since they are heirlooms and presents from family members.

If you have used the shovel or knife or both, I ask you to please return them. It's not only me who is in distress, but also my beloved roomie and especially her mum.

Please please drop me a line in case you can help. I'd be eternally grateful and give you a huge hug.

Thank you,
Lena

Hello People,

If you are travelling to Sweden, I have two special airport coach tickets vouchers which covers 9 cities and 8 airports in Sweden. The ticket is valid till December 31, 2013. Transportation from airport to Stockhom city center is very expensive ( costed 139 SEK =3D 16euros for travel from Skavsta airport to Stockholm city center). I could not use it as I took a long distance train to come back to Germany.

Now, I am selling them for 5 euros each. Please reply if interested ! Will be given on a first come first serve basis. If you have any queries, please let me know.

Good luck with the Finals and Happy Holidays !

The Coping Project
"Alumni share Jacobs stories"

Today:
Everybody feels the same way you do. Talk to your friends and you'll see.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3De6HbP-Vjyg8

[Inline image 1]

The Coping Project was a Jacobs student initiative in 2012. We realised that much of the stress we experienced at Jacobs was due to the belief that others were handling everything much better (were smarter, stronger, had more friends). We realised that all of us had made the same tough experiences and that we were the only ones. If we would have known that others felt the same it would have been easier for us.
Now that we are alumni we'd like to share these experiences for you and we hope that we can make you feel better.
And trust us: No matter how strong and smart somebody may seem, we all experience these tough times in those three years. They pass. They really do. Take a breath, open up and seek the human connection. Tell your friends how you feel and you WILL feel better.

Jacobs Alumni

==== email_text: 
Dear Members of Jacobs Community,



I would like to take this opportunity to say Goodbye to all of you and to
express my heartfelt thanks for making this year on campus a very special
and memorable one for me.



I=92ve had many insightful and inspiring discussions with you on numerous
topics ranging from the challenges in higher education, the role of a
residential campus in the digital age of online learning, the importance of
defining a campus college concept in an intercultural environment, to
strengthening the connection between Jacobs University and the
Bremen(-Nord) community. I am particularly happy that we have secured
commitment from the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and the Jacobs Foundation
through the trilateral agreement and that the first and very promising
steps have been undertaken to find new partners for the development of our
Science Park.



I've very much enjoyed being part of the Jacobs community and loved
attending many of its different cultural and academic events on and off
campus, such as my first graduation as a President, the Mzuka and
J-Cappella concerts, Piano-to-forte, Spotlight, Jacobs Rocks, The Jacobs
Way, the Hanse Boat Race as well as the first Lesum Race. I am already
looking forward to all future events and our victory at the Hanse Boat Race
in 2014!



Keep up the unique Jacobs spirit that I've been able to experience and
which is characteristic for so many people on our inspiring campus. The
devotion to our unique university and the attitude of giving your best and
your lasting and unshakable hope have amazed and touched me many times!



I wish you all the best for the future. Please take good care of yourself
and this amazing place.



With my very best holiday wishes to you and your loved ones,



HO

The meeting time will be at Porter at 5:20 a.m on this Saturday. ( I will give you a wake-up call, if you like but you have to tell me, your name and phone number, in advance, that is, today)

Hey you!

Yeah you ! Are you still stuck on campus? Do servery opening times and Pulse's closure severely affect your happiness and food consumption? No worries my friends! I am now selling tacos! These delicious tacos are cooked by a true Latino man, so you know they will be amazing. These hard or soft shell tacos (your choice) come filled with delicious, lightly spiced beef (vegetarian tacos coming soon) cooked in glazed onions, topped with lettuce, tomato, and the unforgettable combination of "Salsa Rosada" with cheese and the always delicious sour cream!

I am cooking and WILL DELIVER TO WHERE YOU ARE for your satisfaction. WAIT! WHAT? That's right!

You don't even have to move to get these tacos. They will be delivered, fresh and warm, directly to you.

Each taco comes out at only 3 =80!! They will be available most likely DEEP into the night, because I know what it is to be hungry at 3 in the morning.. It is not good. Don't be hungry at 3 A.M. Eat tacos. To order tacos, reply to this spam, comment on the Facebook post, or attempt to call my extension at 6157 ( I might be in the kitchen).

Sincerely,
Joseph Isai Avenda=F1o (The Taco Man)

P.S. I am NOT sorry about this spam, and neither will you be if you eat a taco!

I am pleased to announce the creation of the Taco Time group page, our preferred method of receiving your order! Tonight we have bean only tacos additionally! For more info, join the group. Tacos begin to go out at 8 P.M. ! Have a good night everyone and enjoy a Christmas taco!

https://www.facebook.com/groups/tacotimeteam/

Sincerely,
The Taco Time Team

P.S. If you still prefer to order through email, or private message, that is okay too.

Tonight we have a varied selection! Your choice of a hard or soft shell, filled with either:
Beans (no meat) at 2.75=80;
Beef at 3=80;
or both fillings for 3=80 too!

That's right, that's six possible taco types! SIX POSSIBLE TACOS?!

Tacos will be available all night (while supplies last) while you sit and watch for Santa Claus! Remember everybody, there was no Christmas without tacos.

Tonight, we are selling our limited supply of hard shells only, with your choice of beef or bean, or both. Bean is very limited, so get in while you can!

You know how to get in touch, remember there is a facebook group, the preferred method of receiving your order! https://www.facebook.com/groups/tacotimeteam/

==== email_text: 

Dear students,

happy holidays to everyone!=20

I would like to bring your attention to a couple of initiatives in Bremen which you could join throughout the year 2014, starting from the first full week of January. If you are not in the city yet in January but are interested to join, please write back to me, so I can keep you updated!


If you are a passionate person who wants to do the work that matters to yourself and to the world, and would like to surround yourself with like-minded people, consider joining monthly meet-ups of the Live Your Legend LOCAL Bremen community. The first event will take place on January 7, at the global kick-off date of LYL LOCAL in 140+ cities in more than 40 countries. More (much more!) information and registration can be found at https://LYL-Bremen.eventbrite.com (note: the small registration fee is used to facilitate commitment, all revenue is reinvested into the events).


Tired of setting goals that don't excite you and trying to adopt habits that don't stick? Bored with life? Well, Danielle LaPorte says that when we set intentions, usually we do it because we believe that they will make us feel the certain way. In her Desire Map, she suggests to invert the process and start with defining our desired feelings, and using them as decision filters for our goals and daily activities.=20
The Desire Map Book Club Bremen (a part of the Biggest Book Club Ever with 600+ leaders worldwide!) will work through the Desire Map process in small groups through series of about five-six weekly meetings. At the end, you will learn your core desired feelings, have goals that set you on fire, and find new friends that are there to support you! First wave will start on January 11, registration is at https://DesireMap-Bremen.eventbrite.com (note: the book club is totally free! but you probably want to get your own copy of the book at Amazon / Thalia / Buch.de, or the ebook at daniellelaporte.com)


And there is more to come!

Enjoy the life! ;)

Anatoliy,
on behalf of the (ghost of the) Personal Development Club

dear hamburgers,

I'm looking for accommodation in Hamburg from Mon 6 Jan to Thurs 9 Jan. I am really easy to accomodate; I have slept in a park on a rainy day, on a concrete floor, and even on a tree. Surely, no accommodation could possibly be worse. All I need is a roof over my head and somewhere to lay my head. I'm not simply looking for somewhere to crash as I party and have fun in Hamburg, no ... I'm gonna be there for business. I could make you a tanzanian dish some day.
I promise to love you and your folks for the rest of my life, really.

best,

PS: On one of the days at your place I'll explain to you the meaning of mapundasheshe.

I have created a collaborative playlist on Spotify, New Year Party Mix<http://open.spotify.com/user/1131889194/playlist/30UVVvWXFnykWNVCVtGhxe>, so that you can add your favourite tunes that we can all swing to. Take a look, add your songs and make sure you show up at the party for a fun night!

==== email_text: 
Dear all,
If you have had an unpleasant experience with the Student Services Center parcel operation, please contact me with your story.

If you find it unacceptable that the distribution of parcels may be unilaterally stopped for three weeks, Dec.20th - Jan.7th, even if you were not personally affected by it, please express your support via reply, too.
If you don't find it reasonable that the totality of the mail delivery staff (including Receiving) does not speak a word of English (don't get me wrong, they are nice people, by the way), also let me know.

The COMs are relying on receiving parcels with decorations, entertainment, stationery etc etc on time, so that they may be prepared and ready for the Intersession and the Spring semester. The SSC does not resume regular hours until Feb.3rd!
There are people living on this campus, in fact, some of them, in particular, RAs and CMs on duty, are contractually obligated to stay on campus over the holidays. That our mail is suspended for 3 weeks is a violation, and in fact leads to serious consequences when the parcels contain medically necessary or time-sensitive materials.

I would like your support in bringing this issue to the attention of the leadership.

Best of wishes for 2014,
Pavel Zheltov,
CNM RA.

Dear EECS students,

This semester the course "Number Theory" will be given. (The course 
"discrete mathematics" is NOT given.)
Even though this course is mainly a pure math course and focuses on 
integers, prime numbers, diophantine equations etc. it also contains 
some cryptography (discrete log, certain other public key systems like 
ElGamal, some multi-party-computation). To understand these well, you do 
need some number theory, hence why it fits well in this course.

You can opt to follow the course in full, or to audit certain lectures/ 
the initial part (in the latter, you need to register as audit).

Kind regards,
Stefan Maubach

==== email_text: 
Dear Nordies,

I am selling my bicycle, 5 year old (I am the second owner) since I am leaving Jacobs in the next 10 days.
Here is a picture: http://imageshack.com/a/img577/9237/id9x.jpg
It has 3 front and 8 back gears (3x8=3D24, not 3+8 :P) but due to chain being old and a bit loose 23 and 24th gears should not be used, but still it is fast enough. The seat has a little thorn part, but that way nobody steals it during summer break. Cables for lights needs to be rewired, generator and lights work. I have alternative lights on batteries for the dark Bremen winter time.

Handlers are butterfly style and the angle can be ajusted from aerodinamical 10 degrees (fast but your hands will get tired after a while) to a very confortable angle up to 90 degrees. Front fork and the seat post has suspension which means a relatively smooth ride. Seat hight can be adjusted and suits tall people as well.

Now disck breaks are very sensitive, stops bike immediately. I think all parts of the bike are original Shimano.

Comes with a good pad lock (rahmenschloss - http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004CSVQ7C/ref=3Doh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=3DUTF8&psc=3D1), cable for the pad-lock to protect your front wheel and the seat, rear basket with handler, some hex keys to quickly adjust the seat and handlebars anytime.

Price: 100 euro, negotiable.
Rustam

Tomorrow is a sad anniversary. Guantanamo prison will be open 12 years.

155 prisoners maintain imprisoned in Guantanamo.
Only 9 have been prosecuted or convicted. The others are still imprisoned without a trial
Only against 30 a lawsuit before a Military commission is planned. These Commissions do not fulfill international standards for a balanced and just trial.
46 prisoners will not be released even though they cannot be prosecuted due to lack of evidence.
President Obama reaffirmed the possibility of arrests for an indefinite ammount of time.

Because forgetting about the problem is not a solution Amnesty International (that is not us Amnesty @ Jacobs, but Amnesty downtown^^) will conduct a demonstration tomorrow, January 11th at 11am.

The meeting place is Villa Ichon (Amnesty Office), Goetheplatz 4. The protest march will then procede to Domsheide - Obernstra=DFe =96 Papenstr. =96 Knochenhauerstr. =96 S=F6gestr. =96 Markt and back again.

Hope to see many of you there.

PERFECT!

Cause we need ideas for the script for this year=B4s LipSync musical =3D)

So if some of the above statements are true for you then use the time in intersession to write down some ideas, maybe a few first songs that would fit the plot... Nothing has to be final or perfect, but it would be great to already have some ideas to go on in our first meeting in early February =3D)

Cause the sooner we have a story, the sooner we can start practicing the moves and the choreographies.

So get that pen out and get creative!

As a little inspiration, here is lat year=B4s performance:

Hey everyone!

I am selling my Xbox 360 Slim (Black) with built in Wifi with 4 GB internal flash memory and an additional 40 GB hard drive. The console itself is in top condition, I barely use the thing. I have three controllers (one wired, two wireless). Each controller has its fault such as a button that doesn't "click" when you press it, but they are all fully functional. I also have one basic headset. The only thing is that the power supply is for American power, so you either need to have your own Power Converter (not just an adapter), or I can offer you an adapter as well with everything else.

GAMES:
Call of Duty: Black Ops
Call of Duty: Black Ops II
Soul Calibur IV
Grand Theft Auto IV
Borderlands: Game of the Year Edition (includes all add ons)
3 game disc including Limbo

Prices:
For the Xbox Slim including the 40GB hard drive with one wired controller and LAN cable and AV/HD cable: 100 =80
For each wireless controller: 10=80
For each game: 15 =80
For the power converter with the proper adapter: 20=80

Let me know what ya'll would like!

Sincerely,
Joseph Isai

Dear all,
Happy New Year to all of you!
My New Year 2014 starts with a farewell: I intend to take on new challenges and will leave Jacobs University by January 31.
I am glad that I had the chance working with you students, staff and faculty from all over the world! The unique atmosphere consisting of diverse and international students and faculty made my 11 years here special and an experience of a lifetime. I associate Jacobs University with precious, unforgettable memories to which all of you have made your contributions.
You will not reach me anymore from January 15th. From this date on, you are welcome to approach my colleagues Saumya Pant and Cristina Greculescu for undergraduate affairs and Peter Tsvetkov for graduate affairs. If you have questions regarding the medical excuses, any of my colleagues will be able to assist you.
I wish you and the University the very best for the future which might not be easy, but I am positive that the University with all of you as the heart of it will make its way.
Best wishes,
Savitri da Cruz

Dear all,

Having been one of the 'pioneer professors' at this university from its
beginnings, it's time for me to say good bye.


I have accepted a job as Director of a Research Institute in Japan (Isu
Islands: Greater Tokyo Administrative Area) and will no longer be around at
this university as of January 31st, 2014.


I throroughly enjoyed the time I spent at the IUB/JUB until 2012, the
students, the unique atmosphere, the teaching, the campus,  but I am
equally excited about the new challenge awaiting me in Japan. I shall keep
my Adjunct professorships at Oulu University (Finland), Yokohama City
University (Japan) and Pyongyang University of Science & Technology (Korea).


I wish you and the University the very best for the future, most of all a
'wise' captain to steer the ship into calm waters, and I shall keep being
interested in all of the university's future activities and successes.



Best wishes,

Victor Benno MEYER-ROCHOW, PhD, DSc

You burst with ideas for plots and dialogues? You have a song for every key word or situation? You love to tell stories and design characters? You are all in for drama and tension? You write storylines into your notebooks instead of paying attention in class?

PERFECT!

Cause we need ideas for the script for this year=B4s LipSync musical =3D)

So if some of the above statements are true for you then use the time in intersession to write down some ideas, maybe a few first songs that would fit the plot... Nothing has to be final or perfect, but it would be great to already have some ideas to go on in our first meeting in early February =3D)

Cause the sooner we have a story, the sooner we can start practicing the moves and the choreographies.

So get that pen out and get creative!

As a little inspiration, here is lat year=B4s performance: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DjM6eG21HJec


Let me know if you are interested and come to our first meeting early in February to exchange plot ideas and write up the final script =3D)

Dear all,

as it is nearly impossible to meet everyone on campus to say good bye in person, I'd like to say good bye to all of you.
Beeing at Jacobs since 2003 it's not easy to leave as I gained a lot of experience and worked with wonderful people.

On the other hand I am quite happy that I accepted a new position to gain more experience and really looking forward to start on the 03.02.2014. I will be on campus till january, 29th.

I had a great time on campus and enjoyed very much working with you (especially with the students :-).

I wish you all the best for the future.

best,
Andreas

==== email_text: 
Dear Students,

Jacobs University Career Services Center (CSC) provides in co-operation with Volkswagen AG free tickets for CeBIT in Hannover, the world's biggest and most important fair for digital economy, which will take place from 10th until 14th of March 2014. The tickets are valid for one day visit. Learn more about CeBIT at the official website: http://www.cebit.de/ .

HOW TO GET A TICKET?
Jacobs University students can pick up free tickets (one per student) at the CSC office (RLH 138) during our drop-in hours Tuesdays and Thursdays 10-12 hrs . Please bring with you your student matriculation ID. The number of tickets is limited - first come, first serve - so hurry up!

We encourage especially students of Computer Science, IMS and related majors to take this opportunity - all other interested students are welcome as well. Not only you will be able to see the newest development of the digital world at CeBIT, but also to meet all relevant companies in the field and enlarge your network for your future career!

PLEASE NOTE: You can travel for free with your Semester Ticket to Hannover Hauptbahnhof (only on selected regional trains like RB, RE, NWB, Metronom, Erixx; no ICE, EC or IC trains) and the CeBIT ticket is valid for the city transportation in Hannover - so you will have no transportation costs!

Many greetings from the CSC

==== email_text: 
Hello everyone,

I have a friend of a colleague who is coming to Bremen to conduct some interviews for an article regarding (former) school kids who went to
international schools in other parts of the world, I believe it should show up in the newspaper.

The only criteria is that he is looking for a German girl or a girl with German parents (basically someone who has greater ties to Germany than just studying here). And of course, you should have gone to an international school or have some kind of international background. He already has a male candidate, sorry.

From my experience with his colleague, she was very professional and interviewed me in China for a book she was writing at the time on third culture kids.

If anyone is interested please get back to me. 

Best regards,
JP

==== email_text: 
Dear all,



Long shot maybe, but thought I'd give it a try...



I know some of you and a few of you might now that I coach the women's football team. After our first semester, it has become clear that I could really do with some help for the upcoming semester. Without boring everyone with details here, if you think you have any interest, give me a shout and we can have a chat to see if it would work. Basically, we practice on Monday evenings, Wednesday lunch or evening and have games on Sundays so you would need to be free for that. Ideally, you would be interested in football and if you have any clue or experience, that would be a bonus.



I can't offer much financially but will do what I can to give you some remuneration (you won't get rich!)...that's all for now, if you are interested, we can work out details later.



Cheers,

Rob

For tonight only we are offering hot dogs and drinks for donations to our cause. Donations of around 2 euros are recommended! Also, there is cold beer on tap if you want it.

We are confident that our conference, with over 100 registered delegates, is going to be successful and well received this April.

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] The Cupcake Club!
==== email_text: 
Attention all Bakers!

A few years ago through used to exist a cooking club on campus, as students graduated I think it disappeared. However, the idea behind it was really nice... different students (who probably normally don't cross paths often) with very different ethnic cooking backgrounds coming together to share recipes, food, and time together. I would like bring back the concept and to start a similar group, "The Cupcake Club", with the primary original focus being on different types of baked goods. The idea would be to get together maybe once a week, and to bake something together (maybe if people even like they can bring things to share that are already cooked:optional though), and have the opportunity to meet some new people, learn some new baking tricks, and eat yummy baked goods. Do not feel like you have to be some crazy type of culinary expert to join in, you just need to be friendly and like food.

So, that's basically the idea... but ideas die when no one else shares them, so I would like to have an idea if people would like to join something like this. If you could like to a part of something like this, please message me. The more the better! Once I've heard from a  few people we can establish a meeting time.

Best Wishes,

Hello everyone!

To everyone:
As posted on the Facebook we will be having a meeting this Friday, Jan 31st at 20:30 in the Mercator servery.
This meeting will cover our upcoming African Heritage event. I hope you are all excited.

To the newbies:
A little explanation/introduction to the club.
The African Black and Caribbean club brings together all Jacobs students who are from Africa either by ancestry or birth firstly, to get to know each other and build a sense of family, but also  to provide opportunities for the community at large to experience authentic African culture and heritage through campus events, workshops, and meetings.
Our biggest project each year is the African Heritage event. During these event days, we display our culture through various media ranging from dances to discussion panels. This year is no exception so please join us this Friday as we look forward to hearing what new ideas you have.

Best regards,
Stephanie

==== subject: [EECS-undergrads] graduate courses for 3rd year undergraduate CS
==== email_text: 
Hi,

I like to clarify a few things concerning course selection for 3rd
year students:

a) 3rd year undergraduate students are welcome to sign up for Spring
   CS graduate courses if they meet the pre-requisites and are up to
   the level of a graduate course (typically, these are courses
   continuing the corresponding Fall CS undergraduate course with more
   advanced material)

b) Campus net will not directly show the courses. You have to navigate
   a bit. Here is what I have been told:

   - go to registration
   - go to home school electives
   - go to Smart Systems (that needs to get changed to CS graduate program)
   - now, you can register.

c) 3rd year undergraduate students are _not_ allowed to register for
   the associated graduate labs or project courses.

Dear Students,

I am happy to inform you about recent developments in the department Information Resources/Library and Multimedia:

Britta Molter, formerly Team Assistant in Research V, has joined the library team in a full-time position. Together with Anja Kakau and Stefan Sch=F6n she will take care of your information resource needs. One of her first tasks will be to acquire late orderings of course reserves for the Spring semester - her expertise as book seller will help us well in that process.

Britta Berninghausen, Project Assistant in Physics, from her office in Research III, now assists part-time in the submission of PhD-thesis by our students.

In addition, Dr. Torge Schmidt, CTO in the IRC, will support IR operations as interim director of Information Resources/Library and Multimedia.

I am convinced, that the extended library team will tackle the current challenges to serve Jacobs' academic community as best as possible.


Kind regards

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] Excursion to Strasbourg!
==== email_text: 

Dear Jacobs Community,

I am happy to inform you that Prof. Ress is offering an excursion to Strasbourg from the 31st of March 2014 to the 02nd of April 2014.

On the excursion we will visit a hearing in the European Court of Human Rights (I attached the case we are going to hear), we will also visit the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. In Strasbourg we will go on a boat tour around the city and have a guided tour in the cathedral of Strasbourg.

Most of the costs will be covered. You will only need to pay around 40=80 for the whole trip. This includes all costs for the accommodation in Kehl (German city right next to Strasbourg), breakfast, the transport by bus, the visits of the different sights in Strasbourg and dinner on the first evening (basically all costs, despite the lunch and dinner on the second and third day).

We will leave from Jacobs University very early in the morning on the 31st of March, around 3-4am (the exact time will be announced soon) and come back to campus on the 2nd of April around midnight.

We can take only a limited number of students to Strasbourg. Right now there are 12 places left.  So, if you would like to join this excursion, write me an e-mail in which you bindingly state that you want to join the excursion. We accept registration on a first-come-first-serve-basis. We will give you the exact information about the costs and the time of departure as soon as possible.

For further questions, please address me or Lisa M=FCller-Dormann.

Best,

Johanna and Lisa

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] Introducing jCourse
==== email_text: 
Dear fellow Jacobians,

for several years now, there has been an outcry that professors don't care about their teachings methods; TAs assume too much responsibility; material is completely out-dated; so on and so forth... We all know, no one really cares about course evaluations.

So, we decided to make a better feedback system for all.

http://jcourse.user.jacobs-university.de

- A more transparent feedback system. A professor can't shy away from the fact that his/her course "SIMPLY SUCKS!"
- Now everyone will know how a certain course is like before actually taking it.
- An open space for impartial discussions

Hope you make a good use out of it.

Cheers,
Daniel, Uneeb and Catalin

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] Need social support in building something
==== email_text: 
Dear members of Jacobs community,

This is a friendly reminder for those of you who were not here in January but just came back to Bremen for the Spring semester.=20

If you are an open, positive, active, passionate, growth-oriented person who builds something meaningful and would like to surround yourself with like-minded people, those who would not try to talk you out of your dreams but instead encourage you to go for it, help make your intentions actionable and keep you accountable to motivate you to take those actions, consider joining monthly meet-ups of the Live Your Legend LOCAL in Bremen!

Live Your Legend is a global movement devoted to doing the work that matters (to ourselves and to the world at large). In 2014, the main focus of LYL is on bringing inspiring people together, and one of the means we go about it is through the network of Live Your Legend LOCAL communities. We have kicked the things off on January 7 with events in 150 cities from 48 countries all around the world. Nine people attended the event in Bremen, from whom four were from Jacobs, three living around Bremen and one person came from as afar as Emden (and he comes again to the second event)!

Our next meeting in Bremen takes place on February 4 at 19:00!  More (much more!) information and registration can be found at https://LYL-Bremen.eventbrite.com. Registration closes on Sunday!!!

In case you have problems with registration or don't want to pay upfront but REALLY want to come, use the "contact the organizer" function there and send a short message, I would see if I can issue you a free ticket then.=20

As we need to communicate the number of registered people to the venue for our reservation: if you don't register but then decide to show up at the event, there is a chance that we would not have a place for you to sit! Vice versa, if you register but something comes up and you cannot join us, PLEASE NOTIFY us via "contact the organizer" function of Eventbrite.


Hope to meet some of you on Tuesday!

More fun stuff is coming! ;) In the meanwhile - enjoy the life! ;)


Anatoliy,
in the spirit of the Personal Development Club

==== subject: [jacobs-students-announce] OFFICIAL Spring Semester Energy Course:
==== email_text: 
Dear Students,
I would like to draw your attention to a Spring semester course that focuses on energy and environmental issues: International Energy and Environmental Politics. The course is a bit difficult to find on Campusnet and every year students tell me "I would have taken XY energy course if I had known". I will request that the Registrar post the course in both the SES and SHSS course catalogues. Meanwhile, as I did for the Fall Semester energy courses, I am sending you this notification. As the course is an IES course, many of the topics covered are transdisciplinary-but the course is officially an SHSS course. For SES students, it may provide a relevant and interesting other school elective; for SHSS students, this course could be an opportunity to delve deeper into the social science/political aspects of energy relations and issues.
Best regards, Karen Smith Stegen

Description: Course 040211, International Energy and Environmental Politics (Geopolitics). Instructor: Karen Smith Stegen

Because of the critical importance of energy to a state's stability and prosperity, energy-related strategies and foreign policy have historically been driven by a mixture of economic and political factors. In recent years, environmental policy - particularly pertaining to global warming - has begun to follow suit. In this course students will gain an understanding of the political dimension of energy and environmental matters through an examination of historical and contemporary examples of geopolitical jostling over energy supply (for example, Central Asia, Asia, Russia, the US, South America, Europe, and the Arctic) and by exploring topics such as energy security, nationalization, resource wars, and climate change. We will also assess the political implications of the shift to renewable energy: are political and energy security concerns likely to remain the same, increase or lessen?

==== email_text: 
Dear interested students,
    Some of you might not want to take linear algebra II, but still feel obliged to take it because you don't want to miss out a chunk of material which is important.

    One alternative is self study, which sounds good in planning but rarely happens due to lack of time/motivation. I'm providing another alternative here. I'm thinking about a linear algebra study group, where I will hold sessions once a week to talk about important topics in linear algebra. Different from a formal course, here we don't need to speed up to catch up with the syllabus, nor will we have any workload. It is purely designed for those who want to learn the material by themselves to have a group. Emphasis will be put on thinking and solid understanding, not covering material.

   If you are interested, please reply.

Best regards,
Mengyuan Zhang

I was wondering if anyone else would be interested in a Spanish C1 course? There is one for French, but not for Spanish and I would really like to have one and I'm sure others do as well :)

I asked Dorothee Groeger already if there would be a teacher available, but am still waiting for an answer. In the meantime it would be great to get an overview of how many people would potentially be interested. If you are, get back to me and don't forget to go to the placement test tomorrow ;)

Starting now and for much of the day, I am in the Mercator Common Room selling my belongings. We have two categories here:

1) Things which are actually for sale, but at low low prices! These include a shoe rack, a water boiler, a small rug, a lamp, women's shoes (size 40), and a couple other things.

2) Things which are for free! But donations are appreciated. Especially because I am about to be no longer a student and officially unemployed. So if you'd like to give a couple euros, especially if you take multiple items, that would be great. This includes boxes/bags for storage, a hanging organizer, office supplies, a slightly broken but still functional internet cable, decorations for your room, books/readers, and more.

So please! Come to the Mercator common room and take my belongings away! (But not from the pile which says "do not steal, not for sale" because those are the things I actually need.....)

Dear non-native Spanish speakers ;)

I was wondering if anyone else would be interested in a Spanish C1 course? There is one for French, but not for Spanish and I would really like to have one and I'm sure others do as well :)

I asked Dorothee Groeger already if there would be a teacher available, but am still waiting for an answer. In the meantime it would be great to get an overview of how many people would potentially be interested. If you are, get back to me and don't forget to go to the placement test tomorrow ;)

You burst with ideas for plots and dialogues? You have a song for every key word or situation? You love to tell stories and design characters? You are all in for drama and tension? You write storylines into your notebooks instead of paying attention in class?

PERFECT!

Cause we need ideas for the script for this year=B4s LipSync musical =3D)

So if some of the above statements are true for you then use the time in intersession to write down some ideas, maybe a few first songs that would fit the plot... Nothing has to be final or perfect, but it would be great to already have some ideas to go on in our first meeting on Feb 6th 8 pm in the NM lounge!

Cause the sooner we have a story, the sooner we can start practicing the moves and the choreographies.

So get that pen out and get creative!

As a little inspiration, here is lat year=B4s performance: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DjM6eG21HJec

==== email_text: 
Dear Jacobs community,

According to our community standard, mobbing and bullying of any kind are not acceptable. This includes all forms of communication, face to face or online, that discriminate against individuals or groups (such as sexist remarks, discrimination on account of someone's ethnicity, hateful messages directed against a specific individual, etc.). Any such communication constitutes a severe violation of our community standard.

In the light of recent developments in our community which have involved harassment and bullying online, the Undergraduate Student Government and the Equal Opportunity Committee jointly condemn any such behaviour and want to remind you that it violates our community standard.

We therefore urge you to adhere to our own standards and to treat each other with due respect and consideration.

Best wishes,
The Undergraduate Student Government (USG)
The Equal Opportunity Committee (EQC)

==== subject: [jacobs-students-announce] OFFICIAL Spring Semester Energy Course:
==== email_text: 
Dear Students,
I would like to draw your attention to a Spring semester course that focuses on energy and environmental issues: International Energy and Environmental Politics. The SHSS energy and environmental courses are a bit difficult to find on Campusnet and every year students tell me "I would have taken XY energy course if I had known". I will request that the Registrar post the course in both the SES and SHSS course catalogues. Meanwhile, as I did for the Fall Semester energy/environmental courses, I am sending you this notification. As the course is an IES course, many of the topics covered are transdisciplinary-but the course is officially an SHSS course. For SES students, it may provide a relevant and interesting other school elective; for SHSS students, this course could be an opportunity to delve deeper into the social science/political aspects of energy relations and issues.
Best regards, Karen Smith Stegen
Description: Course 040211, International Energy and Environmental Politics (Geopolitics). Instructor: Karen Smith Stegen

Because of the critical importance of energy to a state's stability and prosperity, energy-related strategies and foreign policy have historically been driven by a mixture of economic and political factors. In recent years, environmental policy - particularly pertaining to global warming - has begun to follow suit. In this course students will gain an understanding of the political dimension of energy and environmental matters through an examination of historical and contemporary examples of geopolitical jostling over energy supply (for example, Central Asia, Asia, Russia, the US, South America, Europe, and the Arctic) and by exploring topics such as energy security, nationalization, resource wars, and climate change. We will also assess the political implications of the shift to renewable energy: are political and energy security concerns likely to remain the same, increase or lessen?

Dear SCDA takers,

Since there is significantly high number of students in this class, there will be four tutorials a week. This will make it better for interaction and space usage. We will be doing the practical part of statistics with some exercises using the software R so everyone should bring their laptops. The class will be in West Hall 3. We will start this week with a simple tutorial on software installation, installing packages and using some important libraries. I have created a doodle poll you can fill in to choose which date you want to attend:

http://doodle.com/n9qch7c9vuqhd7xq

Please be reminded that each day is restricted to 30 students (already configured in the poll) so that we have a fair distribution. The date and time is already in there.

Also, I have put up a teamwork webpage including some basic R tutorial videos and a glossary of some terms and commands. Here is the link:

https://teamwork.jacobs-university.de:8443/confluence/display/SCDA/Statistical+Concepts+and+Data+Analysis+Home


If you have any problems or questions, please feel free to approach me or Tilak and we will try our best to help you with it.

Dear Nordies,

Valentin, our 11 year old son, started last year to learn Russian.
Now he is looking for a mother-tongue speaker, who could motivate him to
learn this language (maybe with some humor and jokes) and could help him
with his homework.

Please contact us if you would like to teach him.

Thanks,
Sylke

You burst with ideas for plots and dialogues? You have a song for every key word or situation? You love to tell stories and design characters? You are all in for drama and tension? You write storylines into your notebooks instead of paying attention in class?

PERFECT!

Cause we need ideas for the script for this year=B4s LipSync musical =3D)

So if some of the above statements are true for you then use the time in intersession to write down some ideas, maybe a few first songs that would fit the plot... Nothing has to be final or perfect, but it would be great to already have some ideas to go on in our first meeting on Feb 6th 8 pm in the NM lounge!

Cause the sooner we have a story, the sooner we can start practicing the moves and the choreographies.

So get that pen out and get creative!

As a little inspiration, here is lat year=B4s performance: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DjM6eG21HJec

Dear graduating students, dear all,

I am one of the co-chairs of this year=92s graduation committee, Fr=E9d=E9rique Mittelstaedt (appointed by the USG, already co-chair of the Graduation ceremony committee in 2013).

The next months will be exciting: the last Jacobs semester, guided research, thesis writing for all graduating students and then there is everything surrounding graduation, like ticket reservations for the ceremony and the ball, hotel and flight booking, graduation rehearsals and much more! The graduation committee, which will be formed soon, will help you with all this as well as organize our graduation day, the yearbook, class gift and much more. So stay tuned for more e-mails from the committee! ;-)

In order to start working as a committee, we need your help! We are looking for two to three final-year undergraduate, one or two (final-year) graduate students as well as one or two first- or second-year undergraduate students for the committee as well as one graduating student who is willing to invest the extra time to be the other co-chair of the graduation committee. One or two students from this group should be explicitly dedicated to the year book, so hint that in your application (just state who you are, your major, class and why you want to join) The application deadline is Feb 7!

If you want to join the committee or have any questions, feel free to e-mail me! And make sure to send your application in time.

Best wishes,


Fr=E9d=E9rique Mittelstaedt
Co-Chair of the Graduation Committee 2014

Dear Nordies,

The German Stammtisch is coming back and as last semester we need German native speakers who want to teach German to their fellow students and help them improve their German speaking skills.

If German is your mother tongue and you want to volunteer please sign up in the doodle poll with your E-Mail address and indicate which day of the week would fit best into your timetable.

http://doodle.com/wv2yuydr3vvadsmf

We need 2-4 German speakers every week and depending on how many people sign up I will distribute weeks for everyone, so that everyone gets a spot every second or third week.

Please sign up by Saturday evening so that we can start next week!

Have a good start into the semester!

You burst with ideas for plots and dialogues? You have a song for every key word or situation? You love to tell stories and design characters? You are all in for drama and tension? You write storylines into your notebooks instead of paying attention in class?

PERFECT!

Cause we need ideas for the script for this year=B4s LipSync musical =3D)

So if some of the above statements are true for you, then come and let=B4s share some ideas and maybe find a few first songs that would fit the plot in our first meeting on Feb 6th 8 pm in the NM lounge!

Dear Nordies,

The German Stammtisch is coming back and as last semester we need German native speakers who want to teach German to their fellow students and help them improve their German speaking skills.

If German is your mother tongue and you want to volunteer please sign up in the doodle poll with your E-Mail address and indicate which day of the week would fit best into your timetable.

http://doodle.com/wv2yuydr3vvadsmf

We need 2-4 German speakers every week and depending on how many people sign up I will distribute weeks for everyone, so that everyone gets a spot every second or third week.

Please sign up by Saturday evening so that we can start next week!

Have a good start into the semester!

Hello everyone!

I hope your semester is off to a good start.
As agreed during last meeting, I have set up a doodle for ideas on a name/title for our event.
Please put some thought into possible connotations/interpretations by others. Also try to capture the spirit of the event as possible through your suggestions.
I am looking forward to them already :)
Here is the link to the doodle: http://doodle.com/xbrqe6d7kpdhe7wg

Secondly, I encourage you to start thinking about the 3 art performances for your region. Think about which one you'd like to participate in (that's right we need you on that stage!). Also think about what props/accesories you might need. Your region leaders will be contacting you about that soon!
Just for the recap, they are:
Robin Nyombi - East Africa
Ndiat=E9 Ciss=E9 - West Africa
Shorai S. Jaffet - Southern Africa.
Feel free to contact them or myself for details on what is going on!

Northern africans please get back to me:)

See y'all around!

Steph

Dear Nordies,

The German Stammtisch is coming back and as last semester we need German native speakers who want to teach German to their fellow students and help them improve their German speaking skills.

If German is your mother tongue and you want to volunteer please sign up in the doodle poll with your E-Mail address and indicate which day of the week would fit best into your timetable.

http://doodle.com/wv2yuydr3vvadsmf

We need 2-4 German speakers every week and depending on how many people sign up I will distribute weeks for everyone, so that everyone gets a spot every second or third week.

Please sign up by Saturday evening so that we can start next week!

Have a good start into the semester!

==== email_text: 
Hello to all friends, foosball players, TOS fans, beer drinkers, etc.!

Next Tuesday 11 February we shall be having a Foosball DRAW YOUR PARTNER style event at the bar starting at 20.00!

For those who do not know DYP:
        - You come alone and are randomly assigned a partner to play with in several doubles matches. He/She shall be your partner for the evening. The random assignment will make sure that you get more experienced players mixing in with the less experienced players, making it more fair for everyone all around, and giving the beginners more opportunities to learn and improve their skill.

The more specific rules will be explained at the bar once we have everyone there, but the general idea would be to have the typical winners and losers brackets. Everyone starts at winners bracket and after the first loss goes down to the losers bracket, then the tournament proceeds with all players proceeding to play as normal. If you lose a second time in the losers bracket, you are withdrawn from the tournament, if you don't lose, you still have a chance to challenge the winner from the winners bracket and get first place.

Winner will get a free beer!

This will be the first bar foosball event we have had and, if successful, we shall continue to have them maybe every other week or so, or even have other kinds of competitions (singles, doubles, mixed, etc.).

If you have never played before -- don't be afraid to try it out! DYP is open for all and is supposed to be fun, and the random assignment will make it more fair.

If you just want to go to the bar and hang out on a Wednesday (or simply to spectate) -- come by for a refreshing beverage, some music, and company!

And if you want to get involved and participate in the event, reply back to me! (j.breuer@jacobs-university.de)

Have a great start to the semester!

Cheers,
JP, on behalf of The Otherside.

Dear graduating students, dear all,

I am one of the co-chairs of this year=92s graduation committee, Fr=E9d=E9rique Mittelstaedt (appointed by the USG, already co-chair of the Graduation ceremony committee in 2013).

The next months will be exciting: the last Jacobs semester, guided research, thesis writing for all graduating students and then there is everything surrounding graduation, like ticket reservations for the ceremony and the ball, hotel and flight booking, graduation rehearsals and much more! The graduation committee, which will be formed soon, will help you with all this as well as organize our graduation day, the yearbook, class gift and much more. So stay tuned for more e-mails from the committee! ;-)

In order to start working as a committee, we need your help! We are looking for two to three final-year undergraduate, one or two (final-year) graduate students as well as one or two first- or second-year undergraduate students for the committee as well as one graduating student who is willing to invest the extra time to be the other co-chair of the graduation committee. One or two students from this group should be explicitly dedicated to the year book, so hint that in your application (just state who you are, your major, class and why you want to join) The application deadline is Feb 7 at 23:59!

If you want to join the committee or have any questions, feel free to e-mail me! And make sure to send your application in time.

Best wishes,


Fr=E9d=E9rique Mittelstaedt
Co-Chair of the Graduation Committee 2014

Dear Nordies,

The German Stammtisch is coming back and as last semester we need German native speakers who want to teach German to their fellow students and help them improve their German speaking skills.

If German is your mother tongue and you want to volunteer please sign up in the doodle poll with your E-Mail address and indicate which day of the week would fit best into your timetable.

http://doodle.com/wv2yuydr3vvadsmf

We need 2-4 German speakers every week and depending on how many people sign up I will distribute weeks for everyone, so that everyone gets a spot every second or third week.

Please sign up by Saturday evening so that we can start next week!

Have a good start into the semester!

==== email_text: 
Hey everyone,

If you would like to get access to the grand pianos on campus, here is what you have to do:

Come to the Conference Hall in the IRC next week Thursday, 13.02.2014 between 13.00-14.00 and play something!
This is not a concert, so no pressure, it does not matter how good you are or whether you have practiced a piece recently. The idea is mainly to get an idea of what level you are at and to make sure you actually know how to play in order to verify that you would use the instruments responsibly.

Everybody who already was on the piano list and had access last semester: You do not need to do anything and will automatically be on the list for this semester again.


Furthermore, please note that Campus Life and Juan Maria Solare, the conductor of Jacobs=92 chamber orchestra, invite you to a short lunch concert in the IRC Conference Hall at 12.00 on the same day, Thursday, 13.02.2014.
Orquesta no T=EDpica, the official ensemble for Tango Argentino at Uni Bremen, will perform seven pieces, ranging from traditional Tango from the Golden Era to a world premiere. The full program can be found at http://www.juanmariasolare.com/prog/Prog-13-FEB-2014-ONT.pdf . Entrance is free, but donations are welcome.

If you have any questions, just write me an email.

Best,
Alexander

==== email_text: 

Hey everyone!

Are you interested in volleyball? Ready to bump, set, spike it? Or maybe have never played volleyball and want to try it this semester?

Then join the Jacobs Volleyball Club!

Our practices this semester will be on:
Sunday and Monday evening, from 8:30pm to 10pm in Sports Hall 4.

We invite you to join our next practice tomorrow, February 10th at 8:30pm in sports hall 4. All skill levels are welcome :)

You must bring a second pair of indoor, non-marking shoes in order to play. These shoes may never have been used outside, period. They must be completely clean and light soled (no dark marking shoes allowed, eg. running shoes). The club leaders have the right to dismiss you from practice if your shoes are not acceptable. Please also bring knee-pads if you have them, and dress appropriately for working-out.

Best,

Alyssa and Bogomil

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] Info for Piano Players / Concert Invitation
==== email_text: 
Hey everyone,

If you would like to get access to the grand pianos on campus, here is what you have to do:

Come to the Conference Hall in the IRC next week Thursday, 13.02.2014 between 13.00-14.00 and play something!
This is not a concert, so no pressure, it does not matter how good you are or whether you have practiced a piece recently. The idea is mainly to get an idea of what level you are at and to make sure you actually know how to play in order to verify that you would use the instruments responsibly.

Everybody who already was on the piano list and had access last semester: You do not need to do anything and will automatically be on the list for this semester again.


Furthermore, please note that Campus Life and Juan Maria Solare, the conductor of Jacobs=92 chamber orchestra, invite you to a short lunch concert in the IRC Conference Hall at 12.00 on the same day, Thursday, 13.02.2014.
Orquesta no T=EDpica, the official ensemble for Tango Argentino at Uni Bremen, will perform seven pieces, ranging from traditional Tango from the Golden Era to a world premiere. The full program can be found at http://www.juanmariasolare.com/prog/Prog-13-FEB-2014-ONT.pdf . Entrance is free, but donations are welcome.

If you have any questions, just write me an email.

Best,
Alexander

Hi everyone,

In case you wanted to try some activities or clubs off-campus or to meet non-Jacobs students and you dare to think outside the box, here are some tips you might consider:

1) State of Bremen in cooperation with Uni Bremen organizes a big number of sport classes, trained by professionals and open to everyone. Students (also Jacobs students) receive a generous discount. Price: around 11 euros for two months. Sports include: box, bodystyling, salsa, muay-thai, yoga, streetdance, hockey, belly dance fusion and many many others. Check them here:
http://www.buchsys.de/bremen/sportarten/aktueller_zeitraum/index.html
Current classes will start on 10 February and will last until 30th of March. You can still register. 

2) If you like or would like to try sailing, try SUB:  http://www.sub-bremen.de  It is a sailing club, not related to Uni Bremen (except the name). You don't have to have experience, nor have a boat, nor be rich. Students pay around 10 euros per month. The club has a number of boats in Bremen, North sea or Baltic sea. Most people speak English (this is the default language in radio communications on sea). 

3) Have you tried horse riding? I don't mean sitting on a horse, while someone holds it. I mean trotting, galloping or even jumping, all by yourself. There are a number of horse riding clubs around Bremen. If you live in Bremen Nord, you should give a chance to Auetal e.V. http://www.rfgauetal.de There you can have up to three 30-Minutes riding lessons before you decide whether to join them. Each lesson costs around 13 euros. They also speak English. 

4) Also check regularly Cultural Center Lagerhaus in Viertel for theaters, concerts, special dance events, special movies or lectures:  http://kulturzentrum-lagerhaus.de/kultur

Have fun!

Eugen

Hey everyone!

Are you interested in volleyball? Ready to bump, set, spike it? Or maybe have never played volleyball and want to try it this semester?

Then join the Jacobs Volleyball Club!

Our practices this semester will be on:
Sunday and Monday evening, from 8:30pm to 10pm in Sports Hall 4.

We invite you to join our next practice tomorrow, February 10th at 8:30pm in sports hall 4. All skill levels are welcome :)

You must bring a second pair of indoor, non-marking shoes in order to play. These shoes may never have been used outside, period. They must be completely clean and light soled (no dark marking shoes allowed, eg. running shoes). The club leaders have the right to dismiss you from practice if your shoes are not acceptable. Please also bring knee-pads if you have them, and dress appropriately for working-out.

Best,

Alyssa and Bogomil (Club Captains)

==== email_text: 
Hey everyone,

If you would like to get access to the grand pianos on campus, here is what you have to do:

Come to the Conference Hall in the IRC on Thursday, 13.02.2014 between 13.00-14.00 and play something!
This is not a concert, so no pressure, it does not matter how good you are or whether you have practiced a piece recently. The idea is mainly to get an idea of what level you are at and to make sure you actually know how to play in order to verify that you would use the instruments responsibly.

Everybody who already was on the piano list and had access last semester: You do not need to do anything and will automatically be on the list for this semester again.


Furthermore, please note that Campus Life and Juan Maria Solare, the conductor of Jacobs=92 chamber orchestra, invite you to a short lunch concert in the IRC Conference Hall at 12.00 on the same day, Thursday, 13.02.2014.
Orquesta no T=EDpica, the official ensemble for Tango Argentino at Uni Bremen, will perform seven pieces, ranging from traditional Tango from the Golden Era to a world premiere. The full program can be found at http://www.juanmariasolare.com/prog/Prog-13-FEB-2014-ONT.pdf . Entrance is free, but donations are welcome.

If you have any questions, just write me an email.

Best,
Alexander

Dear students,

Professor Windt has invited you to a dialogue forum today from 16:00 - 17:00 hrs.

In order to enable as many students as possible to participate, teaching for all classes (except for second year lab courses) is officially cancelled from 15:45 - 17:00 hrs. Classes scheduled to take place from 15:45 - 18:30 hrs. resume at 17:15. Second year lab courses in general take place as usual.

This extraordinary measure was taken because it is of importance that as many students as possible have the opportunity to be present. Hence, Professor Windt is looking forward to seeing you later today.

Best wishes,

Freia Hardt

Dear Nordies,

after the Welcome Back Dinner our two 'young' polar bears were placed in front of the Office cellar in the basement, to be stored properly later. Unfortunately someone took one of them away.

If you have taken him out of affection, please return him to the College Office, as we truly need our bears for events and they are hard to come by and replace.


As always, if you happen to know who took him, please inform me accordingly and the matter shall be dealt with confidentially.

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] [jacobs-students-announce] Even Further
==== email_text: 
Dear Jacobs Community,

following today's email I want to make an important addition.

You might remember that we discussed today about the hypotheses we
developed in our strategic plan. The Board has now informed me that these
hypotheses were only the start of the plans for Jacobs. Unfortunately, a
member of the press spread a rumor that the hypotheses were not as
extensive as they are.

This information -- is -- incorrect. The hypothesis on why Jacobs is
failing is because it lacks strategy, this is clear. The hypothesis of food
is that food is important for survival, and a -- basic -- building block of
life. Mobility is important to --get-- around, very important for our
future strategical choices. Diversity is a place, namely, not Jacobs. We're
currently investing in several civil wars to increase the number of
countries and take advantage of this increased global diversity. The
strategies are strategic in order for future strategies to be fully
strategic in fulfilling overall strategic strategies, strategically.

Further hypotheses:

*Idea 1: LIGHT*
*Creating illuminated surfaces for global understanding.*
Light is an important issue in all parts of the world where the sun sets.
Bremen, light, and Jacobs have an important inter-trans-disciplinarily to
their coexistence. Research topics include:

   - Building an institute of light, how it works and why
   - Analysing lightbulbs and light fixtures throughout campus
   - Implementing illuminated spaces (e.g classrooms, hallways)
   - Creating useful discussions on tungsten vs. halogen

*Idea 2: AIR*
*Understanding the world-wide phenomenon of breathing*
Air is the colourless gas we all love to breathe. Bremen's history with air
dates back to prehistoric times, and remains a cornerstone of modern
industry and small medium business. Air is essential for the operation of
nearly all Jacobs's services.
Examples of research include:

   - Developing "air zones" where air can be breathed inexpensively around
   campus
   - Understanding air as an art *and *a science
   - Creating air institutes to study importance of air

*Idea 3: Inspiration & Foreigners*
*Finding connections and patterns where none exist*
Many cultures, ethnic, religious, and foreign groups live on earth.
Inspiration inspires many inspirational foreigners to travel from a static
to a dynamic state. Often movement is done inspirationally, from foreign
country to foreign country.
Possible research topics include:

   - Explaining whether Africa is a country or a continent
   - Identifying what the fox actually says
   - Linking inspiration to foreigners and vice-versa

In next week's workshop, I want to listen to your ideas on these hypotheses
and hear your answers to some of our most pressing questions.

I am entirely convinced that next week workshops will be incentive needed
to start the change process and will substantially contributes to its
strategic success.

Best regards,

==== email_text: 
Hey everyone,

If you would like to get access to the grand pianos on campus, here is what you have to do:

Come to the Conference Hall in the IRC on Thursday, 13.02.2014 between 13.00-14.00 and play something!
This is not a concert, so no pressure, it does not matter how good you are or whether you have practiced a piece recently. The idea is mainly to get an idea of what level you are at and to make sure you actually know how to play in order to verify that you would use the instruments responsibly.

Everybody who already was on the piano list and had access last semester: You do not need to do anything and will automatically be on the list for this semester again.


Furthermore, please note that Campus Life and Juan Maria Solare, the conductor of Jacobs=92 chamber orchestra, invite you to a short lunch concert in the IRC Conference Hall at 12.00 on the same day, Thursday, 13.02.2014.
Orquesta no T=EDpica, the official ensemble for Tango Argentino at Uni Bremen, will perform seven pieces, ranging from traditional Tango from the Golden Era to a world premiere. The full program can be found at http://www.juanmariasolare.com/prog/Prog-13-FEB-2014-ONT.pdf . Entrance is free, but donations are welcome.

If you have any questions, just write me an email.

Best,
Alexander

==== email_text: 
Dear Students,

I would like to inform you that we have made adjustments in the administrative fees that we request for certain services in the Registrar's Office. These adjustments have been approved by the Academic Board and are as follows:


=B7         Transcripts and certified copies of Jacobs documents: In the past, students could get 10 official transcripts for free and would pay 5 Euros for any additional copy. Certified copies of documents issued by Jacobs (e.g. certified copy of diploma or diploma supplement) , however, were issued for free. These services have now been combined. The new regulation is that overall (i.e. over all studies at Jacobs and for a combination of transcripts and certified copies), a total of 15 copies of transcripts and/or certified copies of documents issued by Jacobs are free of charge. For any additional document (transcript and/or certified copy of a document issued by Jacobs) students have to pay 5 Euros. This change is effective immediately..

=B7         Re-Enrollment Fee: We have introduced a re-enrollment fee. This means that students who have been disenrolled by the university (e.g. due to missing health insurance payments, missing residence permit, etc.)  and right after the disenrollment solve their pending issues can be re-enrolled.. However, they will be charged a fee of 50 Euros. Note: This change will not apply to students who have been disenrolled due to missing enrollment requirements in the last four weeks.

=B7         No other Registrar-related fees were changed.

You can find a summary of all administrative fees applying in the Registrar's Office at https://www.jacobs-university.de/registrar/fees.

With best wishes,
Ulrike Jeschke
Registrar

To all my lovely ladies:

I am a graffiti body painter and have arranged a collaborative session with a photographer friend for Feb. 19th, 10am-2pm, Hochschule f=FCr K=FCnste in the =DCberseestadt.  My previous model had a scheduling conflict, so I'm in great need of a woman who is free on this day and willing to be painted and photographed.

This is body painting and as such will be nude or semi-nude, as you prefer.  Your comfort will always be taken into consideration, and we can arrange your rights to the photos with the photographer should you wish to use them afterward.

Best,
Megan

==== email_text: 
Hey everyone,

If you would like to get access to the grand pianos on campus, here is what you have to do:

Come to the Conference Hall in the IRC TODAY, 13.02.2014 between 13.00-14.00 and play something!
This is not a concert, so no pressure, it does not matter how good you are or whether you have practiced a piece recently. The idea is mainly to get an idea of what level you are at and to make sure you actually know how to play in order to verify that you would use the instruments responsibly.

Everybody who already was on the piano list and had access last semester: You do not need to do anything and will automatically be on the list for this semester again.


Furthermore, please note that Campus Life and Juan Maria Solare, the conductor of Jacobs=92 chamber orchestra, invite you to a short lunch concert in the IRC Conference Hall at 12.00 also today, 13.02.2014.
Orquesta no T=EDpica, the official ensemble for Tango Argentino at Uni Bremen, will perform seven pieces, ranging from traditional Tango from the Golden Era to a world premiere. The full program can be found at http://www.juanmariasolare.com/prog/Prog-13-FEB-2014-ONT.pdf . Entrance is free, but donations are welcome.

If you have any questions, just write me an email.

Best,
Alexander

==== email_text: 
Hello everyone,

Are you a good or intermediate salsa dancer? Have you just started learning steps? Have you just learned some figures from YouTube and want to practice them? Do you want to do something solo? Or would you like to dance salsa to not forget it at all?

Do you dance cuban style? Or L.A. style? New York style? One liner or two liners? 

All those of you, who love salsa, who started to learn salsa, who know some salsa, are invited to the free salsa practice on Saturday at 20:00 to 21:00. No teacher, no mandatory attendance, no fixed time. Salsa music will play all the time and you dance what you like and how you like it. Improve your steps, figures and body movement. 

NOTE: This is NOT a party! Alcohol and inappropriate behavior are strictly prohibited! If you want to party, there are a few salsa clubs in Bremen. Use the time to improve yourself and to ask others for help. 

Time: Saturday 20:00 to 21:00
Location: Nordmetall dance room
Dress: dance in socks or bring additionally dance shoes.
Etiquette: everyone should dance with everyone, but it is not mandatory.

Cheers,
Eugen

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] PLEASE READ & ACT NOW: Your chance to shape
==== email_text: 

Dear students,

please take a minute to read this email and reply if you are interested. To stay in the spirit of this initiative (codename: Anti-Spam Awareness Campaign), THERE WILL BE NO EMAIL REMINDERS from my side.=20


I had struggled a lot with the overwhelming amount of incoming internal emails at Jacobs.=20

Thinking of a bigger picture, it seems to me that people simply do not understand at all what happens after they click the send button on an email to a mailing list, people are not aware of how much time and energy of others they waste with EACH lengthy announcement (and sometimes they send as much as five emails in a single day!!! for several days!). At the same time, we have a lot of other ways of communication which are totally undervalued and underused by students (e.g. Jacobs main site and Teamwork), or a lot of possibilities to organize new ways (e.g. launching a forum platform with topic-focused sections - and I am not sure that it is not there yet, maybe it actually already exists!) that will allow people to get only the information they actually need and/or are interested in receiving, at the time they decide to devote to getting this information and not because they are forced to read everything.

In the end, I unsubscribed from jacobs-graduates list completely - but from that moment, I am totally unaware of things happening on campus and feel left out. I believe this is wrong. I believe there is another way, a much better way to organize our internal communications. I have been bearing different ideas to influence the change, and in my last full semester at Jacobs, I would like to act on them.=20

I am also sure that the question concerns not only me, but many undergraduate students who feel forced to receive and process all the information flow (they start ignoring it and miss the information that is really important for them), and many graduate students who unsubscribe from a spammed list and feel left out, not involved, unwelcome in the community.

Doing this project alone will not allow me to achieve the level of impact that is possible. Thus, I am asking for YOUR help.=20

This is an open call for people who would like to join in the initiative and execute this project. We will need all various types of people:=20
a person to coordinate the group,=20
a person to manage communications from our group to the student body, faculty and staff,=20
people who go there and talk with staff and students,=20
people who do the research around the direct and indirect costs of mass emails,=20
people who do the research about other ways of communications that are already available at Jacobs, as well as those that could be adopted,=20
people who present our findings,
people who write proposals,
designers for posters and presentations,
and everybody else who wants to contribute!!! Maybe you would like to produce a video? Maybe you would like to produce a big piece of art to communicate the vision? Just write back to me!


My first time estimates (everything is to be discussed and adjusted with the initiative group, Campus Life and IRC-IT):
launch of the initiative: TODAY :)
first meeting of the initiative group: around the end of the next week (Feb 20 - Feb 23, I will send a Doodle to the interested students);
awareness-raising communications to students, faculty and staff at Jacobs: from March 1 until the end of the semester;
hosting community-wide event around the end of April.

The purpose is to make a shift in the ways of approaching internal communication between students AND from the faculty and staff to students, such as everybody will feel involved and respected. All the materials produced by us will be passed on to Campus Life, IRC and IRC-IT to be used for educating all the future students around the topic, and published online for public access to serve as an inspiration to other communities who may struggle with the same issues. This is YOUR chance to shape the future of the internal communication at Jacobs.

Let=92s stop wasting each other time. Let=92s stop overloading each other with unfocused, unwanted stuff.=20

Let=92s make Jacobs a better place for us all!


Looking forward to hearing from you!

You enter the Nordmetall dance room and you hear nice salsa music playing continuously. You feel the tempo, you feel the music, you want to dance. Some people are already dancing, some girls are improving the movement of their hips or solo choreography and others are waiting to be invited to dance. You approach a free guy / girl and you invite him/her respectfully to dance. You tell him/her the figure that you would like to repeat and start dancing. 

Time: Saturday 20:00 to 21:00
Location: Nordmetall dance room
Dress: dance in socks or bring additionally dance shoes.
Etiquette: everyone should dance with everyone, but it is not mandatory.

NOTE: This is NOT a party! Alcohol and inappropriate behavior are strictly prohibited! If you want to party, there are a few salsa clubs in Bremen. Use the time to improve yourself and to ask others for help. Use the time to practice what you've learned in Salsa class (in whatever class / salsa school you are going).

Dear Jacobians,

We are looking for people to participate in Facial EMG/Skin Conductance experiment where we are interested in your perception of human and robotic images. This experiment will take approximately 45 minutes; it is not boring and pays 5 Euros or course credit (Stats I, Meta-Analysis, or Stat Concepts)..

Since the experiment involves attaching sensors to the face, the face will be cleaned in a few areas. It helps to come to the experiment with your face washed (limited make up, etc.).

Experiment takes place in Lab 3 (opposite Research 4, one with brain). It is very important that you arrive on time to the experiment! If not punctual, the experiment may not take place. Thank you!

HOW TO SIGN UP:
1. Sign up with your FULL NAME  (poll is anonymous to public):
http://www.doodle.com/ued25fn4hfitamcz - Spaces are limited to availability.. All slots are taken when you cannot choose a time.
2. You will receive a confirmation email only when you have signed up successfully
3. Come to Lab 3 on time for your confirmed time slot
We look forward to seeing you,
Liane

==== email_text: 
Hey everyone!

Are you interested in volleyball? Ready to bump, set, spike it? Or maybe have never played volleyball and want to try it this semester?

Then join the Jacobs Volleyball Club!

Our practices are on:
Sunday and Monday evening from 8:30pm to 10pm in Sports Hall 4.

We invite you to join our next practice tonight, February 16th at 8:30pm in sports hall 4. All skill levels are welcome :)

You must bring a second pair of indoor, non-marking shoes in order to play. These shoes may never have been used outside, period. They must be completely clean and light soled (no dark marking shoes allowed, eg. running shoes). The club leaders have the right to dismiss you from practice if your shoes are not acceptable. Please also bring knee-pads if you have them, and dress appropriately for working-out.

Best,

Alyssa and Bogomil (Club Captains)

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] What is a Perfect fit,
==== email_text: 
You are right: The Jacobs Jerseys!

Do you like wearing perfectly-fitting, good-looking and performance-enhancing jerseys when playing sports/eating food/watching sports?

Do you want your name on the back and YOUR number?

Then I believe you would like to buy a Jacobs University Jersey (popularly referred to as a JUJ)!

Name and number is on the back, and it looks like this from the front: https://www.dropbox.com/s/gu8lvia7jnemlm3/Spam%20photo.JPG

(For a better impression of the jerseys (and a view of more than "cobs niversity"), come to the SCC today at 22:00!)


The Ultimate Frisbee Club (the group of disc-throwing inhabitants of the university) is ordering original "Jacobs University Jerseys" (JUJs) and we invite YOU to also order one - even if you are not part of the team. The jerseys, you see, are sports-neutral.

"Why are you asking me?", you might ask yourself =85 of course there is another reason on top of =93being nice=94: The shirts are individualised and of a high quality, which means also a high price. Each jersey costs 36=80. It reduces to 32=80, if we get 20+ people.

However, if we get 50 people, the price reduces to 27=80 each jersey.

The Ultimate Frisbee Club already aims for around 25 orders - all we need are 25 more orders and we can all share in the reduced price.

Come to the SCC at 22:00 tonight and bring money and your hand (so you can sign the sheet)!

Conditions:

1) He (Stefan) collects 36=80 from you.

2) You sign the order list and tell him your size, preferred name and number on jersey, =85

3) As soon as we have all the orders we can get, Campus Life and Stefan are going to order the jerseys.

4) The jerseys arrive 2-4 weeks later and you can pick them up at the usual Ultimate Frisbee practice sessions or in Stefan's room.

5) If we are 20+ or 50+ people, you get part of the money back! (i.e. 4=80 if we are 20+ and 9=80 if we are 50+ ... please understand, that for logistical reasons this is only possible afterwards and nobody can guarantee that we will in fact be 20+ or 50+ =85 it=92s just our common goal)

Made your decision yet?

We hope to see you at 22:00 tonight at the entrance to the SCC (Sports and Convention Center),

Best regards,
B=E5rd, Stefan and other Jacobs Jersey enthusiasts

PS: For the doubtful souls out there, here is the link. We are going for #6 =93Run-Shirt Kurzarm=94 and we already got the design (see attachments).
http://www.acton-sports.de/images/pdf/preise/ACTON%20Preise%20RUNNING%202011.pdf

PS(2): No promise on the perfomance-enhancement. Though with such a beautiful jersey everyone will expect you to be superior, which will make them perceive you as being superior, which in turn makes you feel superior and which perhaps also makes you perform better!

Dear Jacobians,

We are re-opening a few time slots for the experiment - perception of human and robotic images. It is a Facial EMG/Skin Conductance experiment that will take approximately 45 minutes and pays 5 Euros or course credit (Stats I, Meta-Analysis, or Stat Concepts).

Since the experiment involves attaching sensors to the face, the face will be cleaned in a few areas. It helps to come to the experiment with your face washed (limited make up, etc.).

Experiment takes place in Lab 3 (opposite Research 4, one with brain). It is very important that you arrive on time to the experiment! If not punctual, the experiment may not take place. Thank you!

We look forward to seeing you,

Dear all,

Yesterday, the German newspaper "Die Zeit" published an article about Jacobs University. I think it is important that we are aware of how Jacobs is presented in the public. This is why I ask you to take the time to read this article (the newspaper can be found in the IRC ground floor, the article is in the section "Chancen")!
After reading it, maybe you even feel like writing to the editor and make your opinion on the matter heard. In the end it is us who can judge best about this place!

Unfortunately, the article is in German, but this shouldn't be a problem, since we have 40% German students on campus...

Have a nice day and come to the meeting tonight at 7pm in the IRC Foyer!

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] New Campus Life Guidelines for Services and
==== email_text: 
Dear Students,

We hope you saw the mail earlier today regarding the new online Campus Life Club Portal. This is part of an ongoing effort to automate and improve our services - we soon hope to launch an online Student Event Planning system as well.

In addition to developing such tools, and perhaps more importantly, it has become very apparent to us and many of you that we lack clear definition and transparency in terms of such issues as funding policies and deadlines for services. After much consideration and analysis of best practices gained over years of cumulative experience we have recently defined these to a large degree.

In short, we hope to move away from a reactionary culture of last-minute ad-hoc efforts and decision making to a pro-active and fair plan-ahead culture. Our goal is to plan at least a semester ahead for large-scale events and activities. The main reason for this is to reduce considerable stress and work for all concerned, not just staff but also student organizers and student assistants who make so many things happen around here. We have noticed that our current system is unhealthy for many of us either in terms of work-life balance or academic performance.

We realize that we cannot just enforce these new deadlines and policies overnight, and we are already in touch with the USG and GSA about how to collaboratively create and develop such a new culture over the course of the next semester/year and will adapt/amend these new policies and deadlines as we test them out together. We ask you for your support and welcome your input.. Please contact us and your USG/GSA members if you have any feedback/input to help us all succeed in this mission.

To see the policies as well as a revised Club Handbook please visit our Campus Life teamwork site: https://teamwork.jacobs-university.de:8443/confluence/display/CAIA/General+Info+and+Policies


Thanks for your support!

Best,
Ren=E9 on behalf of the Campus Life team

Dear Jacobs Students,

We are conducting a study focusing on fan identity here at Jacobs.

Werder Bremen fans who are 18 or older are kindly invited to participate. Participants will be given 10=80 or course credit (Stats I, Meta-Analysis, or Stat Concepts) for their participation.

The study includes a questionnaire, a computer test, and a measure of bodily responses.  This will involve cleaning the face and attaching three sensors to different areas of the face. This experiment takes about one hour to complete.

Again, only Werder Bremen fans are asked to participate.

If interested, [using your full name] pick a time slot here: https://www.doodle.com/btbqvc6rxhd56c7w (make sure to scroll right & hit save)

If successfully signed up, you will receive a confirmation email following registration.
This experiment takes place in Lab 3 (opposite Research 4, door on the right).  We ask that you arrive on time so that the experiment can take place.
Thank you!
Hannah

I know we are all very excited about the new TV in the lounge, but we are all very keen on winning the LipSync category in the Arts Olympix, right?

So, here is the great big favour I would like to ask of you:

We are currently using the lounge as a practice space and would greatly appreciate if the couches could remain at the edges of the room. Of course you are still welcome to use the room, but it would be awesome if you could return the couches back to the sides afterwards.

Please also don't remove any of our props which are stored there.

Sorry for the inconveniences caused and hopefully we'll reward you with a golden duck on Saturday =3D)

Cheers,
Corinna

==== email_text: 
Dear Jacobs community,
As one of the organizers for the "What the hell is happening?" assembly, it has been brought to my attention by several students that many people were unable to attend the assembly, and many who wished to speak were unable to present their opinions.  If you have a point that you feel is vital to the change process, please send it to me.  If it seems to be a position with a lot of student support, it will be worked into the student response to the change process (the document that is being given to the workshop attendees).
For the sake of organization and my inbox, it would be nice if the point you bring forward could fall into one of the following categories:

a) a priority of the student body (i.e. a value or characteristic of the university that should not be altered during the change process)

b) input regarding the change process (examples: suggestions to help improve financial viability, reactions to the information that has been released by the administration so far, suggestions for improving their proposed plan)

c) a student concern (problem areas that need to be dealt with, both concerning the change process and in general)

Hopefully these categories aren't too restricting.  For now, send me your input, and let your voice be heard!

Cheers,
Lydia Somers

100*150 cm?! Are you talking about the shower towel or towel for gym?! My shower towel is 67*140 cm, my carpet is 100*150 cm and I am afraid if I can find something that big. I am really confused now! As far as I know and I have seen the gym benches and other machines, there is nothing wider than 40 or maybe 50 cm.

Please help me get out of this dilemma!

Thank you again.

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] Jacobus Startup Lab 2014
==== email_text: 
Dear Graduate and Undergraduate Students,


I am thinking about starting a start up lab from middle of the March.  If
you are interested in entrepreneurship, start ups or direct hands on
approach to starting a business, please read below for further information.


*Jacobs Startup Lab 2014*


*Aim*

To enable students to fast track their business idea to launch a start up.


*Idea*

The idea is for individuals and team to work for the period of 1 or 2
months on their start up. And in order to help them the seminars on team
formation, idea generation, estimation of ideas worth, fund raising will be
carried out. At the end the team or the individual are expected to have
developed semi or fully finished product or service.


*Description*

The program will run for the duration of 1 or 2 months and will include
following programs

1.       Idea generation seminar

2.       Workshops on how to build an idea to start up (From Jacobs alumni
          working on their own startup)

3.       Seminar on fund raising (VC, Crowd funding, Government funding,
            business competitions)

4.        Networking with fellow like minded entrepreneurs

5.        Weekly work on their own start up and presentation of the
progress            made (if you wish this can be secret)

6.       Team formation (you might have the idea but might not have found
            right people)

7.       Experience sharing from successfully failed start ups

8.       And more


*This will not include*


1. This is not a competition. The main idea is to work on your own projects
and get help from people who have already tried and tested their approach.
So you will have no direct monetary prize.


2.NO Business plan...the idea is to try and fail in your work as many times
as possible. Hands on approach is expected


3.You start your own business and you retain the profit or loss incurred on
your own. Your ownership will not be transferred to anyone.


If you are interested in participating in such an event, please get back to
me by Tuesday (25th February, 2014). If I find that sufficient numbers of
people are interested, I will initiate the process. Thank you very much for
your time.



Yours Sincerely,

Tilak KC

We will be going from servery to servery to update you guys about what is happening and answer your questions. See you tonight! :)



Positions are open for the following USG Co-Chair positions

The Academic Affairs Committee (AAC) is responsible for representing the interests of students in all aspects of university life relating to academics.. We work closely with staff and faculty in both the Office for Academic Affairs and the Undergraduate Education Committee (an all-university committee with representatives from faculty, staff and students), and seek to improve the quality of teaching learning at Jacobs University.

The Public Relations Committee (PRC) functions as a communication bridge between the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and the student body. We make sure that students are informed about the decisions made within the USG and the projects carried out by different committees; and bring students concerns and queries to the USG for discussion. We also have projects aimed at keeping students updated about important events and instances happening on campus.

The External Relations Committee (ERC) of the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) was created in 2010-2011 with the goal to establish, facilitate and uphold relations to organizations and institutions outside the Jacobs community. These relations are to be made with external organizations and institutions either independently, on behalf of students, or in coordination with other organizations or institutions. The ERC is also here to help existing relations of student-run organizations; however, it shall not intervene unnecessarily or unilaterally take over existing contacts between a Jacobs university student club and an external organization or institution. [Two positions are open for here, however one is a replacement position for half a semester and is only applicable to Krupp. The other full-year (spring-spring) position is open to all colleges].

The Internal Affairs committee (IAC) is concerned with the relations between Students and faculty, Students and admin, Students and students and Residential Colleges. We establish, facilitate and uphold relations with clubs and other internal institutions and help existing relations of student-run organizations. Please note this is a fall position that needs to be filled, and will have to be re-elected again in the fall. Only Students from Nordmetall may apply.


Positions are open for the following USG Chair positions:

The Information Technology Committee (ITC) is responsible for digital and electronic information processing, the usage of current and future technologies and digital resources. It monitors the digital information acquisition, storage, access and exchange, ensures the availability and necessary functioning of all used technologies, the available digital resources and services, gives advice on the use of future technologies and manages the available student-run resources and services. The Committee accepts complaints concerning any of these areas and tries to react to them, if necessary.


Two replacement (half-year) positions are open for Student Court.

Student Court Judges interpret the constitution and by-laws of the USG as well as the community standards to resolve disputes thatmay arise on campus.

==== subject: [college-nordmetall] Outdoor Courts
==== email_text: 


Dear members of the Jacobs community,



I received in the last days a couple of e-mails, asking me to hang up the tennis nets or the basketball hoops on the courts.





Due to the Safety Regulations (Berufsgenossenschaft Bremen, the regulation for running outdoor courts at universities in Germany: =A7 2 BGV A1 i.V.m. BGI 895 Nr. 2.2.2. ), it is not allowed to use the outdoor rubber courts during the wet season (01.10.2008 - 31.03.2009). With the fall weather, it becomes dangerous, as the courts get very slippery. This is why we take down the nets and basketball baskets. Thank you for your understanding!







You are allowed to use the courts again as of 1st April, 2014







Please don't hesitate to contact me, if you have any further questions.







Best regards



Michele Lapenna

HEY everyone!

First of all, this semester's IMN is kicking off this Sunday at 8pm in the C3 MMR. And we're going to bring you Sister Act an American film!

But wait, there's more. Last semester we had trouble figuring out when the best day and time was for our events. Although the people who came said they really enjoyed it, so few people were able to come. So this semester we've decided to outsource. We want you to tell us when the best day is for this event and what movies you would like to see.

What this means is, I want you to tell me the best, funniest, etc. movie from your country (Especially if you're from a country in Africa). And, I want you to tell me what the best day is for us to host this event. There's just one tiny catch, Football fans have the MMR on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (I'm pretty sure) so that's automatically out of the question. Otherwise please tell me on which day if the event was held you would definitely come watch a movie with us here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nuiJuBo3kQNKeliTsHIKXQIPAhgL8XFfhDIRbJKZiv0/viewform

Positions are open for the following USG Co-Chair positions

The Academic Affairs Committee (AAC) is responsible for representing the interests of students in all aspects of university life relating to academics.. We work closely with staff and faculty in both the Office for Academic Affairs and the Undergraduate Education Committee (an all-university committee with representatives from faculty, staff and students), and seek to improve the quality of teaching learning at Jacobs University.

The Public Relations Committee (PRC) functions as a communication bridge between the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and the student body. We make sure that students are informed about the decisions made within the USG and the projects carried out by different committees; and bring students concerns and queries to the USG for discussion. We also have projects aimed at keeping students updated about important events and instances happening on campus.

The External Relations Committee (ERC) of the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) was created in 2010-2011 with the goal to establish, facilitate and uphold relations to organizations and institutions outside the Jacobs community. These relations are to be made with external organizations and institutions either independently, on behalf of students, or in coordination with other organizations or institutions. The ERC is also here to help existing relations of student-run organizations; however, it shall not intervene unnecessarily or unilaterally take over existing contacts between a Jacobs university student club and an external organization or institution. [Two positions are open for here, however one is a replacement position for half a semester and is only applicable to Krupp. The other full-year (spring-spring) position is open to all colleges].

The Internal Affairs committee (IAC) is concerned with the relations between Students and faculty, Students and admin, Students and students and Residential Colleges. We establish, facilitate and uphold relations with clubs and other internal institutions and help existing relations of student-run organizations. Please note this is a fall position that needs to be filled, and will have to be re-elected again in the fall. Only Students from Nordmetall may apply.


Positions are open for the following USG Chair positions:

The Information Technology Committee (ITC) is responsible for digital and electronic information processing, the usage of current and future technologies and digital resources. It monitors the digital information acquisition, storage, access and exchange, ensures the availability and necessary functioning of all used technologies, the available digital resources and services, gives advice on the use of future technologies and manages the available student-run resources and services. The Committee accepts complaints concerning any of these areas and tries to react to them, if necessary.


Two replacement (half-year) positions are open for Student Court.

Student Court Judges interpret the constitution and by-laws of the USG as well as the community standards to resolve disputes thatmay arise on campus.

To apply please send a one page motivational statement (with a CV picture) tousg.secretariat@jacobs-university.de with the subject [Your college] USG Application for any of the chair positions.
If you are applying for Student Court please make out the email to the same address as above, but with the subject Student Court Application.

The application deadline is Wednesday the 26th of February.

Dear All,

I just want to clarify some things for those that filled out the doodle pool for the experiment advertised couple of days ago.

1. Only East-Asians and Germans are eligible, thus if you signed up and are not contacted, it means sadly you cannot participate.

2. You will receive a confirmation email one day before your test date.

3. More slots will be open soon.

For all rest, sorry for the spam and have a great week!

FINANCIAL  AID  RENEWAL  PROCEDURE





Dear Undergraduate Students,



As announced previously, the financial aid renewal procedure has been discontinued so you do not have to submit a new financial aid application. Your financial aid package will remain the same and carry over to the academic year 2014-2015 unless:



1.       you have a scholarship and your GPA drops to a 3.0 or below after the spring semester 2014. In this case, you would lose the scholarship and your financial aid package would be recalculated.

2.       you have urgent reasons for an adjustment in your financial aid package. In this case, please send an email to your financial advisor or to sfs@jacobs-university.de<mailto:sfs@jacobs-university.de> by April 1st. We will then inform you of the renewal procedure.

Thank you.

Best regards,

Nancy Trey

Dear person who stole my bike (a blue and white one with gears and shocks with Rex written on it, tied outside College 3 A block), kudos on the lift.

I sincerely hope that you enjoy the bike or the money you get from selling it.

It really sickens me though that you are part of a community that I too am a part of.. so to even things out, or to compensate for the act that you committed, I'd like to do a good deed. I offer you 50 euros if you can come up to me and tell me you stole it. You can keep the bike, and you can keep the 50 euros, too. I will let you go untouched. Just to show you what it means to live in the civilized world.

There's really no way for him to be sure. However, it's obvious that there are people on campus who borrow/take bikes from campus. Case and point, my bike--a green thing-- is currently parked outside east hall with its pedal broken off again. I didn't ride it there but someone did. (Whoever you are I salute you for going through the effort to ride a bike with flat tires, no brakes, and a broken pedal all the way from Nordmetall to east hall. I'm sure it saved you a great deal of effort.) anyways, TL;DR there are people on campus taking bikes. We're a small community and they should really think about their actions.

Jeesus, just let him grieve about his bike a bit. I can see no shame in pointing out that especially in such a dense and allegedly constructive community such as ours one shouldn't just take other people's stuff. Anyone who ever had some food in the floor kitchen is aware of the fact that not every member of Jacobs was educated in such a way.

 Hello people,

You might have noticed that apparently bikes are disappearing again (I know of 3 cases right now, myself included).

There is a HUGE hole in our fence behind Mercator next to the trash containers. So if you like your bike I would advise you to take it down to the basement (you never know if a lock will stop a thief)...

I hope facilities will take care of this soon.

Best,

Gesa

Okay Nordies, Here is the deal:

Tonight, after the LipSync we will come back to Nordmetall and celebrate the hard work of all Nordies who took part in Arts Olympix, and those who cheered for them.

All Nordies are invited. So, come to the MMR and get pumped for the Pajama Party.

There are going to be surprises waiting for you. You Don't Want to Miss This.

Hello everyone!

I hope you are doing wonderfully.
Please join me on Friday March 7th at 19:00 in Mercator servery for a general meeting.
It is important that we retouch bases and remain updated about what is going on.
I hope this is an early enough warning for your schedule to be able to accommodate it.
Until then stay awesome.

==== email_text: 
Hey,

This Friday (28.02.) I seem to have misplaced a grey bag with labcoats. We had them when we were practising for the Lip Sync in the cinema, afterwards we went to the Dance room in NM. We didn't find them in either space. Two of the 3 missing labcoats have something written on them. One says "Apokalypse" and the other has amino acids written on either the collar or parts of the arms. So if you have seen, taken or heard them please respond to this email as we need them back urgently (2 of them were only borrowed).

Thanks in advance and congratulations to everyone for these fantastic Arts Olympix!

Dear Jacobs Community,

Due to busy schedule and lack of time my place has gotten out of hand. I need someone or a group of people to clean my place, take out the trash, do the laundry and iron the clothing. Regardless of the number of people a fix price will be paid. I know you all have classes and this is not going to be easy to finish in a day. However, luckily I will be out of town next weekend and the 3 days are perfect to organize my living space again.

If you are interested and would like to earn some money maker sure to contact me.

The price shall be discussed.

Best wishes and kind regards,

==== email_text: 
Hi Nordies,

it was a great performance at the fire alarm, everyone went out quietly,
noone used the elevator, you got out quickly. Great job.

Also in future: remember to take your coat/something warm and just in case
rainproof. If it is a trivial alarm as today it typically takes only few
minutes, but we had cases that took more than 40 minutes and you don't want
to freeze to death outside.

Have a good night, and watch your toasters!
Cheers
Thomas

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] A Very Nordie Play
==== email_text: 
My dear polar bears,

You may have already wondered about the lawn around the fountain on your
front door. You may have thought: "Is this not an amphitheatre? Are these
grassy steps not seats around a stage? Is this not perfect for a play!?"

The answer is YES IT IS! We're going do put on a *One Act Play* around the
Nordmetall fountain for the *One Act Play Festival in May*!

Two years ago we ran a pilot project: a short, adventure-filled 1 act play
outside NM's doorstep. Last year technical (and weather) difficulties
taught me an important lesson about scale, so we're at it again with a
better understanding of how to make it work.

It will be a relatively short (40-50 minutes), fast-paced adventure. Exact
performance dates depend on weather, of course. The One-Act Festival itself
is schedule for 12-17 May, so we'll aim to perform around that time.

Reply if interested in *acting or writing*! I want to make this a
Nordmetall tradition!

In our first meeting (time TBA) we'll discuss what kind of play to do
(naturally I have a proposal and script of my own but as I said I want to
make this a NM tradition) and work out a story. Then once we have a script
ready we can begin rehearsal. Fun and excitement await!

Cheers,
-Trevor

Good morning y'all,

so as you can probably tell, it's been a challenge to find a spot when we all have time.
Some can't make it to either the Friday and Saturday slots I had previously selected, so I have set up a doodle.
I have considered Eid and other meeting you guys informed me about when setting this up.
I only have one thing to ask of you:

Please only choose a slot if you are 100% sure to make it on time!
Don't make us move that meeting if you will not show up anyway or will show up late.

Here is the link to the doodle:
http://doodle.com/s7yxp6s55fzxwsk3
Please fill it in by tomorrow afternoon latest.

I really hope we find a slot that works for everyone.

Sorry for any inconveniences.

Kind regards,
Steph

==== email_text: 
Dear students,

We cordially invite you to a public talk by the renown political scientist Eric Uslaner (as part of the BIGSSS Field C Colloquium)!


Dr. Eric Uslaner, Professor of Government and Politics (University of Maryland, USA), will present on:

"Overcoming Risk: Diversity, Segregation, and Trust".

Wednesday, 5 March, 2014
14:00-15:30
Jacobs University Bremen
Conference Room, Campus Center
http://jacobs-university.de/2014/02/dr-eric-uslaner-overcoming-risk

Abstract:

Generalized trust =96 faith in people you do not know who are likely to be different from you =96 is a value that leads to many positive outcomes for a society. Yet some scholars now argue that trust is lower when we are surrounded by people who are different from us. I challenge this view and argue that residential segregation, rather than diversity, leads to lower levels of trust. Integrated and diverse neighborhoods will lead to higher levels of trust, but only if people also have diverse social networks. I examine the theoretical and measurement differences between segregation and diversity and summarizes results on how integrated neighborhoods with diverse social networks increase trust in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia. I also show how different immigration and integration policies toward minorities shape both social ties and trust.

Everybody is welcome - we look forward to seeing you!

Best wishes,

Here is a link to the printer: http://www.amazon.de/LaserJet-P1102-Laserdrucker-Drucker-600x600/dp/B003ANFRU2/ref=3Dsr_1_7?ie=3DUTF8&qid=3D1393960373&sr=3D8-7&keywords=3Dhp+laserjet+1100

Thus, if there is anyone who is willing to give away/sell their ticket(s) - can you please get back to me? We can negotiate on the prize :)

Looking forward to your replies.

You can speak about your own experiences or your opinion on gender, sexuality, identity or feminism.

If you fancy an example, watch one of last year's monologues: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dr7ESH2Kwo_U If you do not like standing on a stage, no worries. You can also write a monologue and let it be performed by someone else. If you do not want to write a monologue, but perform one on stage, here is your chance. We welcome all gender identities.

If you are interested or want more information write to me: j.dufner@jacobs-university<mailto:j.dufner@jacobs-university> !

Or come to our next meeting for the play:    Thursday, March 6th, 21:00

==== email_text: 
Dear students,

Today's talk also counts towards the APS module (Jacobs Lecture Series).

A kind reminder:
We cordially invite you to a public talk by the renown political scientist Eric Uslaner (as part of the BIGSSS Field C Colloquium)!


Dr. Eric Uslaner, Professor of Government and Politics (University of Maryland, USA), will present on:

"Overcoming Risk: Diversity, Segregation, and Trust".

Wednesday, 5 March, 2014
14:00-15:30
Jacobs University Bremen
Conference Room, Campus Center
http://jacobs-university.de/2014/02/dr-eric-uslaner-overcoming-risk

Abstract:

Generalized trust =96 faith in people you do not know who are likely to be different from you =96 is a value that leads to many positive outcomes for a society. Yet some scholars now argue that trust is lower when we are surrounded by people who are different from us. I challenge this view and argue that residential segregation, rather than diversity, leads to lower levels of trust. Integrated and diverse neighborhoods will lead to higher levels of trust, but only if people also have diverse social networks. I examine the theoretical and measurement differences between segregation and diversity and summarizes results on how integrated neighborhoods with diverse social networks increase trust in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia. I also show how different immigration and integration policies toward minorities shape both social ties and trust.

Everybody is welcome - we look forward to seeing you!

Best wishes,
Franziska Deutsch

Hey everyone,

WE ARE BACK! AND BETTER THAN EVER! AND WE STILL NEED YOUR HELP! :D

Now, we are fair people. YOU help US and WE will help YOU!

Whether it is for EXTRA CREDIT IN STATS or Meta-Analysis or just to relieve your hunger with some delicious chocolate!

So what do you have to do?

Just fill out this simple questionnaire (around 5 minutes):

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bs4ewSFq5yHTUpHeqXoS10_A5oMz5yMIvSS-zsyp3SM/viewform

We are looking for a specific group of people and therefore we cannot accept everyone that fills out the questionnaire. The rewards will only be given to the people that we contact with a doodle poll to sign up for possible testing time slots.

Thanks a lot for participating and we'll contact you afterwards regarding the testing!

P.S. The results of the questionnaire will be fully confidential!

==== email_text: 
Dear Students,

At some point Saturday/Sunday night last weekend a beer bottle was thrown through the car window of a guest professor staying at the guest house who had parked near The OtherSide.

If any of you know anything about this, I ask you please to come forward to help resolve this matter. Needless to say the guest professor was very upset and such a thing does not help our external reputation at all. I hope it was just an unfortunate accident and not an intentional act and that we can find an amicable and responsible solution for all concerned.

Again, if you know anything, I ask you please to get in touch with me as soon as possible.

Thanks for your support.

Best,

Ren=E9 Wells

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] IMPORTANT: Possible CSC Financial Support for
==== email_text: 
Dear Students,

Career Services Center (CSC) has recently been approached by growing number of students, who were asking us for financial support for different kinds of their career related activities, as for example if we can finance or pre-finance their trips to workshops abroad or to interviews with potential employers.

With this email, I would like to clarify what financial support programs Jacobs University students may expect from CSC to avoid any misunderstanding regarding this issue.

As already announced in diverse information emails and sessions for students, CSC provides several programs to support students to complete their mandatory internships. You can find detailed information here: http://www.jacobs-university.de/career-services/internship_funding .

PLEASE NOTE: CSC does not have any additional programs for financial support of students besides those mentioned at our Internship Funding website.
CSC does not guarantee any student a financial support for her/his internship. All decisions for internship funding are done within a clear application process and have very limited funds. Therefore, we recommend our students to search for compensated internships in order to secure their income for living expenses during the internship. If any additional support programs will be offered in future, CSC will inform all students and update the given website accordingly.

IMPORTANT: CSC will hold an additional Internship Information Session next Tuesday, March 11th 2014; 12:30-14:00 in ICC Conference Room, for which you already received an invitation email. Please register here: http://www.eventbrite.de/e/internship-information-session-tickets-10831602615 . We will provide all details and answer your questions regarding internship funding during the session.

Best regards
Yours

In a comfortable and safe atmosphere we will talk about this semester's play Dinner Party Disruptions. the play consists of self-written monologues. If you fancy an example, watch this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dl4e8VMmgaEY. If you do not like standing on a stage, no worries. You can also write a monologue and let it be performed by someone else. If you do not want to write a monologue, but perform one on stage, here is your chance. We welcome all gender identities.

If you cannot make it tonight or want more information write to me: j.dufner@jacobs-university.de!

Hey everyone,

WE ARE BACK! AND BETTER THAN EVER! AND WE STILL NEED YOUR HELP! :D

Now, we are fair people. YOU help US and WE will help YOU!

Whether it is for EXTRA CREDIT IN STATS or Meta-Analysis or just to relieve your hunger with some delicious chocolate (Ritter Sport)!

So what do you have to do?

Just fill out this simple questionnaire (around 5 minutes):

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bs4ewSFq5yHTUpHeqXoS10_A5oMz5yMIvSS-zsyp3SM/viewform

We are looking for a specific group of people and therefore we cannot accept everyone that fills out the questionnaire. The rewards will only be given to the people that we contact with a doodle poll to sign up for possible testing time slots.

Thanks a lot for participating and we'll contact you afterwards regarding the testing!

P.S. The results of the questionnaire will be fully confidential!

Hand watch specifications: CASIO , colour=3Dmetalic, slightly damaged, used.. One can think that the second hand is not working(the one which shows seconds), however it not a second hand, it is chronometer which can be activated by pressing one of the buttons on the right side of the watch.

I promise the reward for the one who will find them and return them back to me. Thank You

Jacobs University's effort to expand its horizons with our surrounding community continues. Ballschule, the first ever Jacobs community service program, in collaboration with Werder Bremen and local schools in Vegesack returns with a 500Euro DAAD scholarship!


[https://exchange.jacobs-university.de/owa/attachment.ashx?id=3DRgAAAADz9Z857EK7TqPEPZYP1UhzBwDQrUI6Xu9oTp0EH6jsIjFtAAAAULhPAADQrUI6Xu9oTp0EH6jsIjFtAAAAc7NzAAAJ&attcnt=3D1&attid0=3DBAAAAAAA&attcid0=3D62164f80-d6b4-4192-b427-6f0ec271023f]
The Ballschule Team: Tianmi, Sofia, Siggi, Maria, Imran, Celine

         The program involves:

  1.  Jacobs Students getting trained by Werder Bremen professionals  in various hand and eye coordination activities and ball games
  2.  The group of trained Jacobs students and the Werder trainers lead a school activity called =93Ballschule=94 for the kids in the Vegesack schools

We are looking for 1st and 2nd years (not going abroad in the fall) who would be available starting April 2014 for training, and then available for the project in Fall 2014.

The group of students must be seriously committed to the program, in representing Jacobs, and giving to the community. This is a very big opportunity, and you can be part of it!

If you=92re interested,  please fill out the application form ( http://goo.gl/AV1oIv )  so we can forward more information to you and consider you as a possible candidate for the project.

Best wishes,
Ballschule Team!

Whether it is for EXTRA CREDIT IN STATS or Meta-Analysis or just to relieve your hunger with some delicious chocolate (Ritter Sport)!

So what do you have to do?

Just fill out this simple questionnaire (around 5 minutes):

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bs4ewSFq5yHTUpHeqXoS10_A5oMz5yMIvSS-zsyp3SM/viewform

We are looking for a specific group of people and therefore we cannot accept everyone that fills out the questionnaire. The rewards will only be given to the people that we contact with a doodle poll to sign up for possible testing time slots.

Thanks a lot for participating and we'll contact you afterwards regarding the testing!

P.S. The results of the questionnaire will be fully confidential!

Dear Nordies,

over the weekend one of our Table Tennis tables in the Common Room has been damaged beyond repair.

Sadly, no one has owed up to it yet! Unfortunately the college funds do not allow for the purchase of a replacement, therefore the community will have to make do with the remaining table.

I can only urge you to treat common property with greater respect and to look out for those who don't, to reprimand or to report them.

==== email_text: 
Dear Nordies,

You have voted on the new logo to be printed on our Nordmetall hoodies at the beginning of the year.

We have been searching for the right colour (dark purple) and quality for a while, and a sample of the hoodie to be ordered is on display at the College Office now.

To choose the right sizes, we have samples from XS to 2XL from another supplier. Please disregard the colours.

Please come by the College Office and choose your size, place your order on the sign-up sheet and hand me a deposit of Euro 20. The final prize depends on the number of hoodies ordered and tax, handling and bank fees as we import them from abroad. Expect to have to pay at least Euro 6 or 7 on top upon collection. We apologize for not being able to give you a more precise figure.


Cheers,

==== email_text: 
Dear Jacobs Community,

Please note that due to construction work, there will be some changes to the Nordwestbahn schedule over the next few weeks.
The most important ones for Jacobs students are:
March 27th-28th: A total of 13 early morning and late evening trains are cancelled between Bremen-Burg and Bremen-Farge (i.e. they will not run to Bremen-Sch=F6nebeck). There will be a bus service instead.
March 30th-31st: No service between Bremen-Burg and Bremen Hauptbahnhof after 6pm. There will be a bus service instead, or you will have to change to a different train.

There will be further changes on the section between Hauptbahnhof and Verden from March 16th - 27th.

I recommend you verify your train times on www.bahn.de<http://www.bahn.de> before travelling on the affected dates (all changes seem to be accurately reflected there).

==== email_text: 
Hey guys,
Thank you very much for the many replies and follow ups. I talked to the woman, who approached me, and here is what she said:
The single mother is willing to pay 5=80 per session. She is looking for a girl who can teach her 10 year old boy English. In addition she would like the tutor to help her son with 3rd grade math (in a separate session). Each session (Math & English) are thought at different times and consequently paid seperately. This also means that if you are only interested in teaching the boy Math, that is negotiable.
Concerning German skills, you have to be able to explain everything in German since you are teach someone English and/or Math. It doesn't need to be perfectly fluent.
If you are still interested please send me another e-mail.

Kind regards,


Siegfried Wegmann

==== email_text: 
Hello everybody,

I want to organize a Jacobs University- "Happy" Dance Cover (by Pharrell Williams) to not only show how amazingly diverse our Campus is but also to represent and send a positive message to people that do not know Jacobs too well yet.

To make this project a success, I'm looking for team members and dancers for the video.

I need people to:

- help with directing
- film the video
- help me with editing
- dance for a part of the video


It's inspired by the 24 hour long original:

http://24hoursofhappy.com/

And you might also know this version (Vegesack) already
(even though I think that we can make a better version together ;))

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DoX5N9stM9jM


If you are interested and think you can contribute in any way, do not hesitate to contact me
Let's represent Jacobs in the most positive way we can! :)


I'm looking forward to an amazing project,

Sevda

Dear Nordies,

thank you so much for the nominations we have received so far. Please note
that a nomination should come with some text, or at least a list of some
items explaining why you nominate that person. This is very important as
the committee members - in particular those not living in the college -
need some details to form an opinion.

So please those who just sent a name, please add some sentences. There is
also no problem in teaming up with the nomination text.

Thanks a lot, we are looking forward to further and more elaborate
nominations

Enjoy the weekend
Thonas

It will be in the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification) department. Even if they say they want graduates, he has informed me that undergraduates can also apply. For more info and how to apply, visit:

http://www.unccd.int/en/programmes/Capacity-building/CBW/marketplace/Pages/VacancyListingSearch.aspx?FilterField1=3DVacancy_x0020_Type&FilterValue1=3DInternship&&FilterName=3DTitle&FilterMultiValue=3DUNCCD*

You should find both of them there.

Kindest regards,

For those of you who dont know, the NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament is happening now in the USA, and millions of people every year "fill out" a mock bracket to predict who will win! Some people choose by way of "coolest team name", others by the "underdog mentality" and a few actually know whats going on ;) I have created a group for Jacobs, just log in to ESPN (or create an account, it takes 2 minutes) and search for the group:

Filling out a bracket can take from 2 minutes to 2 hours, but I guess for most of us it will be closer to the 2 minute side ;) enjoy!!!

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] Why does this keep happening?
==== email_text: 
Dear community,

 

On behalf of the indoor football club I would like to voice my concern about
how sports clubs are handled on campus. Yesterday, when I came to the sports
hall my co-members and I were notified by the porter on duty that it is no
longer allowed for our club to use the sports hall. As evidence he showed us
a printed e-mail from Michele Lapenna to the campus security office (the
porters) stating that from Friday the 14th onwards he should not let the
indoor football club, the hockey club or the cricket club into the sports
hall. Since the club leaders hadn't received an e-mail from Mr. Lapenna we
were obviously surprised.

 

After asking the porter whether we could go in anyway and after he declined
we tried to think of a reason for this situation. The club had been
registered on the campus life website and the attendance list for February
had been sent on time. The goals had always been returned to their
respectable place, there were no dirty shoes and the doors had always been
closed properly.

 

It could also not be the club fees. The club leaders had already decided not
to take one. Since they took one last semester they thought that was enough
to ask from the members. And I agree - the fees collected last semester are
enough to get more materials if needed. Why would they then ask the members
for more?

 

All together I am not very surprised though. This whole situation is just
another story added to the long list of questionable things happening to
sports teams and clubs on this campus. Whether it is the rugby team being
expected to get to their tournament in a porter van that is not certified to
leave campus, or the football team not being able to practice because of an
arbitrary booking system, or the female football team not being able to
attend their own guest practice - all these situations were entirely
unnecessary.

I saw in the practice times that the hockey team and the cricket team must
have encountered the same problem. Do you know why we can't get in? And does
anyone know why this keeps happening?

 

#SOSIndoorFootball #ImYourVoiceIndoorFootball

 

In the hope to play indoor football again soon and on behalf of the indoor
football club,

 

 

Tom Suberg

 

 

PS.: Please keep in mind that this is an e-mail sent by the whole indoor
football club and not by me as a person.

==== email_text: 
Dear Tom, the Indoor Football Team, and any other clubs involved in this,

First off, I am sorry to hear that this happened. I was not informed of this from campus life, despite our resolve for increased communication. I will of course immediately look into what happened and how it can best be resolved for our clubs. In the future, please feel free to directly contact the sports committee. We are your direct representatives to campus life, and hopefully we will get this straightened out as soon as possible. Again, we as a committee should have but were not informed of this. The teams should have but were not informed of this. Hopefully it will be straightened out as soon as possible. I ask everyone to allow me and the committee time to contact Campus Life and sort this out.

Thank you,

Tyler Buchman

Dear East Asian, Dear Germans, Dear Americans,


Are you looking for Stats 1 Credits with Prof. Dr. Boehnke? Perhaps Meta-Analysis credits with Prof. De Santis?
Then participate in my short experiment and help me do my research for my bachelor's thesis!


http://doodle.com/7cirdpvv2x6uzerf


The experiment revolves around EYE-WITNESS TESTIMONY (cool right?) and will only take you 20 minutes!

Just follow the link and fill out when you can come to the Psychology Lab and I will contact you for further instructions.

My thesis really depends on your participation, so I really really appreciate all of your help! Thank you so much!


Best,
Kyle Richardson

==== email_text: 
Hi everyone,

I talked to Bendick and he said we get the chance to shift the Midterm in
order to not have it on a Saturday. That's why I propose the following
option. Let's have it on the Wednesday afterwards (26th) at 11:15 at the
class time until 13:15. This way we don't have more material, we can still
have lunch afterwards, people with weekend plans have a more relaxed life
and potentially we might be able to drop the evening lecture at 17:15?

Please vote on this poll until next lecture.

Hey everyone,

WE STILL NEED YOUR HELP! :D

ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE OF THE XY CHROMOSOME (A.K.A
MALES)

Now, we are fair people. YOU help US and WE will help YOU!

Whether it is for EXTRA CREDIT IN STATS or just to relieve your hunger with some delicious chocolate!

So what do you have to do?

Just fill out this simple questionnaire (around 5 minutes):

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bs4ewSFq5yHTUpHeqXoS10_A5oMz5yMIvSS-zsyp3SM/viewform

We are looking for a specific group of people and therefore we cannot accept everyone that fills out the questionnaire. The rewards will only be given to the people that we contact with a doodle poll to sign up for possible testing time slots.

Thanks a lot for participating and we'll contact you afterwards regarding the testing!

P.S. The results of the questionnaire will be fully confidential!

Hey all,

Do you have any painkillers that you can spare, or anything that might work for a terrible toothache? Ibuprofen doesn't seem to do the trick and it might be a bit early for vodka. Anyway, if you can help, reply to this email.

Thanks!

Specifically I would need a surgical clinic (chirurgische klinik for the germans) that is situated in bremen.

I would prefer if you have previous experience or at least know someone that has had good experience with a doctor there, I can use google myself :P that's why I want personal recommendations.

if you don't know anyone sorry for the spam, and thank you in advance for those that can help a guy who needs some info

Have a fantastic day Everyone!!! :)

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] Strasbourg excursion, 4 last spots
==== email_text: 
Dear Jacobs Community

Once again the information regarding the Strasbourg Excursion. Since four people dropped out, we now have 4 more spots open. So reply quickly. Also you would have to transfer the money by Friday either to my account or give it to me in person, further information on that will follow once we have filled up the four spots. SO find below again all the information:

I am happy to inform you that Prof. Ress is offering an excursion to Strasbourg from the 5th of May to the 7th of May 2014.

On the excursion we will visit a hearing in the European Court of Human Rights (I attached the case we are going to hear), we will also visit the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. In Strasbourg we will go on a boat tour around the city and have a guided tour in the cathedral of Strasbourg.

Most of the costs will be covered. You will only need to pay around 40=80 for the whole trip. This includes all costs for the accommodation in Kehl (German city right next to Strasbourg), breakfast, the transport by bus, the visits of the different sights in Strasbourg and dinner on the first evening (basically all costs, despite the lunch and dinner on the second and third day).

We will leave from Jacobs University very early in the morning on the 5th of May around 3-4am (the exact time will be announced soon) and come back to campus on the 7th of May around midnight.=20

We can take only a limited number of students to Strasbourg. Right now there are 4 places left. So, if you would like to join this excursion, write me an e-mail in which you bindingly state that you want to join the excursion. We will accept registrations on a first-come-first-serve-basis. We will give you the exact information about the costs and the time of departure as soon as possible.

For further questions, please email me

Best,

Dear all,


A friend of mine is writting her thesis on fiscal pressure/tax burden and economic growth and she is looking for some statiscal research databases like eurostat,worldbank, where she could find indicators by country e.g. gdp,fdi,gini index etc) over long periods of time (20-30 years or more). If you have any idea that our library might provide this type of information, or if you know any other source, please let me know.

Thanks for your time,

Hallo Teodor,

The exam will cover lectures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. 
Lectures 13 and 14 will not be covered since we have not discussed them 
in detail during an afternoon session.

We will use the usual scheduled room - West Hall 5 for the exam, but 
instead of breaking at 12:30h, we will break at 13:15h i.e., the paper 
is two hours long.

I hope you don't mind my copying to your colleagues since I assume they 
also need clarity on this.

Let me know if you have more questions.

Dear everyone,

I=B4m not sure who is responsible for the horrific internet connection on campus in the last weeks (and months), but I think that person(s) should really get a reminder to fix it.
It used to be better at some point. But now it is an insult to everyone who depends on a reliable internet connection for work/study. For instance, I need remote access to clusters for the work on my thesis and it is literally impossible to work when I get kicked out of the internet every 5 minutes.
Does anyone know who to contact for this or ideas what to do about it? Maybe a joint complaint would also be a good idea.

Cheers (hoping the connection is good enough for the email to reach everyone),
Matthias

Dear football players among Jacobs University Bremen,

Dear ladies and gents,

This year I (Vlad Petca - 2nd year Master Logistics) will represent the ICFT team Pink for 2014. I will be one of the captains, together with my good friend Branimir Ivanov.
Most of you know at least one of us.

It would be a great pleasure from my side to invite you to be part of the new team we are building for this season with more passion and team spirit then the last years.

We managed to get into the final last year and eventually win the second place after a long and very intense tournament. It was tough and sometimes too outgoing (considering some particular reactions) but all those will change (I will personally make sure of it).

Therefore, whoever is interested in participating in ICFT 2014 and would like to play, I invite them to write me an e-mail and we will try to make it happen.

Join Team Pink boys and girls !!!!

With all my respect and fairplay,

==== email_text: 
Dear Community,

the Intercontinental Basketball Tournament (ICBT) will take place on the 1st of May. We kindly ask teams to sign up by April the 1st so we can proceed with the organization.
Please send the list of your team name and members to both Nick (n.reick@jacobs-university.de<mailto:n.reick@jacobs-university.de>) and Tim Jesper (t.suhrhoff@jacobs-university.de<mailto:t.suhrhoff@jacobs-university.de>).
The first team (East Europe) has already signed up and depending on the structure of the tournament there will be only space for 6 or 8 teams. So don't wait to long and sign up quickly! =3D)

The general subdivision is into the teams Africa, America, Asia and Europe. There may be several teams for one continent. The maximum team size is 8 people.
A player should play for the team that he feels represents him the most. Thus, one does not necessarily have to have the citizenship of a country belonging to that continent. However there must be an obvious reason, such as that the player has lived for a long time in that continent. Citizens of Oceania may join any team.
In case there should be an argument the tournament organizer will decide about specific cases.
Each team has to have at least one girl on the court all the time.
Cheers,
the ICBT team

==== email_text: 
Want to relax and listen to some really good music? Stressed out by all the midterms and quizzes?

The orchestra Bremer Orchestergemeinschaft is playing a concert at the Interfaith House in the Campus of the Jacobs University Bremen on Friday 28th March 2014 at 8pm.

Before you ask: yes, it is free. Nevertheless, donations are welcome and encouraged.

The repertory is classical orchestral music by Beethoven, Mozart, H=E4ndel, Satie and three Argentine composers from the XIX Century: Esnaola, Alberti and Alcorta.

If you read or at least decipher German, there are plenty of details here: http://www.juanmariasolare.com/prog/Prog-Maerz-2014-Bremer-OrchesterGemeinschaft.pdf

By the way, the conductor of the Bremer Orchestergemeinschaft (aka BOG) is Mr. Juan Mar=EDa Solare, who also happens to conduct the Jacobs Chamber Orchestra (so if you play any instrument and are serioulsy considering joining the Jacobs Chamber Orchestra, you can investigate unnoticed how things might work under his inspirating guidance).

Last but not least, one of the flutists of the Bremer Orchestergemeinschaft<http://www.bremerorchestergemeinschaft.de/> (Henrike Diesing) is a student at Jacobs University.

Will we see you there?

==== email_text: 
Dear Jacobs Community,

on behalf of the International Office I would like to inform you of a new writing competition launched by Global English Editing. You can read the original message below.

Best,
Franziska


Hi,

We have launched a writing competition that I think would be of interest to Jacobs University Bremen students.

Entrants must detail their vision for the world in the year 2030, in 200 words or less. They can explore a range of topics, including technological and scientific developments, the state of humanity, the environment, and politics. The winning entry receives $1000.

A renowned team of judges who will evaluate the ideas, including Gerd Leonhard, a leading Futurist and best-selling author; Katherine Keating, Contributing Editor to The World Post; and Amir Dossal, founder of the Global Partnerships Forum.

Details of the competition be found at http://www.geediting.com/competition.. It's a really interactive writing competition where we can view the entries, comment on them and create a community around our vision for the future..

We would love Jacobs University Bremen students to enter the competition and outline their vision for the future.

Cheers,

Brendan Brown

Hey all,
I was last-minute asked to host one of the students here for Jacobus this weekend but I don't have any extra blankets/pillows. They told they would have that or an organizer had that all figured out, but apparently not. Does anyone have an extra pillow/blanket I could borrow through the weekend.

For those who do NOT need Stats credits, but would still like to help a soul in need, you can still fill out this survey for my thesis - pretty please? :D


You can get credits for your classes by taking this survey from your computer, at home, right now.
It will take around 10-15 minutes maximum.

If you are furthermore interested in participating or just being updated regularly about BRIMUN, feel free to visit our webpage http://brimun2014.com/ or to like our Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/BRIMUN?fref=3Dts

Additionally, pictures from last night will be available soon.

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] Update on Grad-Ceremony Tickets..
==== email_text: 
Dear all concerned:

There is still negotiation between the Graduation Committee and the Academic Affairs Committee regarding the distribution of remaining/ unused Graduation Ceremony Tickets going on at this moment.

**I would like to emphasize that the respective parties are ONLY the Graduation Committee and the AAC, and has nothing to do with the Registrar or any other group or committee at this moment in time, so if you asked the Registrar anything in regards to this topic, your information is not up-to-date.**

Furthermore, I have received several complaints that the information regarding the extra/unused tickets shouldn't take this long to decide and it is unfair to those students who wish to have more than 2 guest at the graduation ceremony because these students cannot make plans.

I agree with you, this decision is taking far too long to make, but with anyone who has ever tried to negotiate anything with a body of power, it is very difficult and takes a while. I can only urge you to maintain your patience. But of course, that is your choice.

But I disagree with the point that is is unfair to the students who wish to have more than one guest at the ceremony.  I believe that:
1) whether a ticket is available for an individual or not does not necessarily facilitate or hinder said person from purchasing plane tickets or booking hotels. It only dictates whether they can enter the SCC for the approximately 3 hours that the ceremony takes place. It doesn't stop them from celebrating with the graduate after the ceremony or attending the Grad-Ball.

But,
2) if the individual only wishes to come to Bremen if they can sit in the SCC for the ceremony, then I guess it is unfair, because then they won't book their flights or hotels until this decision regarding how the unused tickets will be distributed is made and the price for the flight or hotel may be much more expensive by then.

If you are one of these people who considers it unfair, as stated in option 2 and cannot be patient, then please, by all means, buy Grad Ceremony tickets that people choose to sell because they don't need them, and risk having this ticket you purchased be invalid at the actual ceremony as well as spending considerably more money for a ticket than you would have to if you were patient.

Sorry that this email may not have the new many of you had been hoping for, but if you can just bear with us for another week or two, the final decision will be made and we will inform you immediately. If you cannot, please see advice provided in blue text.

On behalf of the Graduation Committee 2014,
Lex Hassiak

Hello Jacobs community,

I desperately need to borrow a bike for today from approximately 22:00 until 6:00 tomorrow morning, and the same thing tomorrow. Otherwise I will be left walking around Bremen at 3 in the morning with all the creeps, and I will be very sad and possibly dead. If anyone is willing to lend me theirs, I will be so grateful that I will sacrifice to the sun gods for you 20 times, and I will buy you a pizza from the Pulse. If anyone is willing to sell me a bike for under 60 Euro that is rideable immediately, traffic safe and does not need repair, well, you will be making 60 Euro tonight. And if you really want that pizza, you can have that, too.

Thank you and please reply immediately if you have something.
Best,
Victoria

==== subject: [mercator-students] If you are still in need of Graduation Ceremon=
==== email_text: 
Just a reminder:

Every graduating student receives 2 tickets for FREE and in previous years have sold them for OVER 200=80. The Graduation Committee wishes change this to make the tickets be free or be sold for 20-25=80 max. They may also be bound by name and ID will be checked at the ceremony in order to be admitted. But the decisions are not finalized yet.

So as a warning:

If you buy a Graduation ceremony ticket on the ''black market'' you risk having this ticket you purchase be invalid at the actual ceremony as well as spending considerably more money for a ticket than you would have to if you were patient and waited for the official decision.

Dear Tilak,

I think the main point here is not that you cannot sell your ticket - it is rather that if someone buys it it might be INVALID. Even though I support your opinion since I expect 4 people and thus I need extra tickets, I think we can wait a bit more and see what the graduation committee will decide.

==== subject: [jacobs-students-announce] OFFICIAL New: Expanded Language Course
==== email_text: 
Dear students,

the Undergraduate Education Committee and the Academic Board have agreed to expand the undergraduate policies concerning the language courses.
The modification of the policy concerns language course transfer credits and is valid as of now.

Parts of paragraph 3.11 have been changed accordingly:

Old version:
"Transfer credits may be accepted on approval; only courses in the languages taught at Jacobs University will be accepted; only courses taken at other universities or at our partner institutes (Goethe Institut, Instituto Cervantes and Institut Fran=E7ais) can be transferred."

New Version:

"Transfer credits may be accepted on approval; courses in the languages taught at Jacobs University will be accepted if taken at other universities or at our partner institutes (Goethe Institut, Instituto Cervantes, Institut Fran=E7ais, Confucius Institute); credits acquired in languages other than those offered at Jacobs University will only be transferred if issued by a partner university of Jacobs University."


The first part of the policy (stating that we accept German, Spanish, French and Chinese language course credits from any university and/or partner institute) is still valid. The policies have been expanded so that we will now also accept transfer credits from language courses which are not offered at Jacobs (with the exception of English) which have been issued by our partner universities. Partner universities run a student exchange program with Jacobs University based on a legally binding contract regulating all procedures for a student exchange.

The expanded policy allows students who go abroad to one of Jacobs' partner universities to choose a language course of their choice, for example in the native language of their host country, and receive transfer credits. The university will thus foster language learning and strengthen existing partner programs at the same time.

Please note that all transfer credits need to be approved prior to a stay abroad.

See the full policy here: http://www.jacobs-university.de/policies

Best regards
Dorothee Groeger

as Title  says it,

I missed someone so much.  I was taking a beautiful spring nap and in my dream I met  him...
I was so happy to see him. I cried and jumped with joy.(yeah,a bit of exageration..)

Then I woke and realized it was "only just a dream"...

If you find my missing friend(A lovely Dark blue round pencil case with pens,) ,well you are literally making my dream come true. (with my gratitude)
Well, I don't have much hope of meeting him since it's been a while i lost him :p. I decided to at least try since I had this "'werid dream" today.

Thanks, 
and Enjoy rest of spring break!

==== email_text: 
Dear all,

I hope you are all enjoying Spring break. As I am sure you have heard, a major security breach was detected across sites that use one of the encryption protocols on the internet on April 7th this year. The breach was nicknamed 'The Heartbleed Bug", and it is a bug that causes vulnerabilities in the OpenSSL crypotographic library (allowing malicious people to steal personal information from sites that are normally protected by this protocol), which is used by roughly two-thirds of all websites on the Internet.

I recommend that you generate new passwords for your most critical sites (such as email, banking, social networks etc.). Most of the sites are now taking measures to mitigate the problem; for most sites, the vulnerability has been patched, but a password change is still recommended. Better to be safe than sorry :).

For more information on the bug, visit http://heartbleed.com/ and http://en..wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed.

Best regards,

Ango

Dear Jacobs Community,

I have been approached by a couple of friendly locals representing boat clubs who are interested in anyone from our Jacobs community who might want to learn how to sail and/or get involved with boats down in Vegesack. They have old boats and new boats, a youth group, and a trainer from Portugal who speaks five languages and is eager to see what we might be able to develop. We can either integrate some students in their youth group or start our own group of any age-level and they seem very flexible about their schedule. We can learn to sail and eventually take nice day trips in the local area or longer tours for those interested. Staff, faculty, and grad students are also particularly encouraged to get involved since the main season is in summer and most undergrads are not here . . . !

Costs for such fun would depend on how many people participate - the more the cheaper!

Hit reply if you are interested so we can see if there enough interest to pursue this idea.

Best,

Ren=E9

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] (VIP) SAD OBSERVATION !
==== email_text: 
Dear All,

unfortunately it is not that easy. In Germany there are very strict laws regarding food and the sale of food that are meant to protect consumers, producers, and small and large merchant companies. However, this often results in good food being thrown away for no reason.
Unfortunately, all the websites I have found are in German - if someone could find that in English, it would probably be better.
Basically, there is the Tafel in general (http://www.tafel.de <http://www.tafel.de/die-tafeln/tafel-suche.html> ) and in Bremen specifically (http://www.bremertafel.de/frames.htm) who might take food donations. However, they generally only take food directly from the supermarkets that is close to expiration date. I doubt they would be willing to take food from a catering service - again: food regulations.
FYI:
Because many people in Germany do not agree with the wasteful food regulations, communities have established themselves around the principle of "Containern" or "Dumpstern". (See: http://www.dumpstern.de/was-ist-dumpstern/ .) This means that people will go to the containers near a supermarket and take the unopened and still perfectly fine food from the trash and eat that. In fact, this is how most people who cannot afford food and quite a sizable number of university students at get their food. Both activists as well as people who just can't afford it do this. However, this is ILLEGAL. Some big chains of supermarkets have even installed cameras just for that reason. (Though it's unlikely you get into real trouble even if caught.)

On the whole, I agree that this is a very serious issue, but I doubt that it would help anything if the USG would get involved in this. There are other ways to get active. Due to the food regulations here in Germany, it is very unlikely that the surplus from Apetito would be accepted anywhere.

Best,
Lydia

Hallo,
I am organising free German language courses for different cooperating
partners
(one of them is the AStA of Bremen University). Our courses can be visited
by
students and non-students and reach from level A1 till C1. They take place
at
the communication centre Paradox, Bernhardstra=C3=9Fe 10-12 (nearest station:

If you have something like a noticeboard for the students of jacobs
university,
it would be nice if you could share the following text:

"The AStA Uni Bremen (and different cooperation partners) offers free German

Dear community,

As most of you probably know, tonight is Easter. Me and Kristina are going to go and receive the light from an Orthodox church tonight around 23:20 (to be sure we are there at 00:00). We have two options, both of them are Russian churches, and they are in the proximity of Bremen-Walle, so we will probably take the 23:07 train towards Bremen-Walleand then walk for 5-10 mins.. We will take the light, pray for half an hour and probably head back afterwards. If there is anybody interested to join us, please reply to this message.

Happy Easter holydays to everybody, even the infidels!

Who are Student Advisors?
Student Advisors will be in charge of helping out freshmen integrating into the community, on and off campus. It is a large responsibility, as you will play a big role in determining the first impressions of the incoming class!

What are the requirements?
1. Please apply in pairs (if you do not have a partner but would still like to participate please email us directly).
2. Each from a different sex and nationality.
3. Different Majors. You can pair with anyone from any school, as long as the person doesn't share the same Major as you.
4. Please be kindly reminded that you will have to be back on campus on the 25th of August
5. All current first and second year students are eligible to apply. Foundation year students please email us directly if you are interested in this position.

Dear all native German speakers,

One of my best friends is graduating from German major in a Chinese university this summer. She is writing her thesis for her bachelor degree. At this moment, she is in an urgent need of having someone who speaks German as his/her mother tongue to check her thesis. Basically, grammar only!

The title of her thesis in German is Anregungen des Strukturwandels des Ruhrgebiets f=FCr die alte Industriezone im Nordostern Chinas. The thesis is approximately 5,000 words and not extremely academic. She is willing to pay for your help and effort. Reward is negotiable!

If you are interested in earning some pocket money for your coming summer travelling, please get back to me! And we wish you all a very nice Easter Monday!

Best,
Shijia & Kedi

Dear all,

This is a chance to boost your methods course grade by obtaining some extra credit in return for your participation in a 30-min psychology experiment.

The task is quite simple - you will be looking at pictures of human faces and inanimate objects and will answer questions related to some of them. Throughout the experiment we will be measuring how your body responds to the images via sensors attached to your face and your hand.

If you are interested in taking part please respond to this email to make an appointment.

Further information:

==== email_text: 
Dear instructors,

On April 30, 2014 from 12.30 to 14.00 the Equal Opportunity Committee is organizing an Open Discussion Panel on Sexual Violence addressing students and other members of the Jacobs community. As this topic is of high relevance to the whole community and beyond we recommend that you excuse students leaving early (10-15 min) in courses from 11.15 to 12.30 that day in order to attend the panel on time.

Please note that this is a recommendation for excuse, which means that the final decision as to whether the students are excused or not rests with each instructor of record (for the policy text, see http://www.jacobs-university.de/policies-undergraduate-classroom#7.5_Excuse_from_Academic_Obligations).

Sincerely,
Daniel Hendrichs (on behalf of the Registrar's Office)

On Saturday after the deadline, the program will be run and the results sent by e-mail. You will be able to check which college you have been allocated to. The next phase - Tall and Triple rooms will begin at midnight on Saturday.

If you have any questions, feel free to send an e-mail to me or any of the guys on the cc.
Please fill in your preferences on time. We don't want you to get a random college either. We'll keep spamming to remind you.

Cheers,
Gautam

Dear Room Allocation Committee,
I have a question on the process and two remarks on the programme.
Firstly, is there any first-come-first-serve element in specifying your
choice, or does it not matter in when you specify your preferences, as
long as you do it?
Regarding the programme, it still says room allocation process 2013 on
the college choice page; and if your browser setting block the site from
setting cookies, nothing happens. A helpful interface would complain and
tell me to allow cookies; this one just does nothing.
I would suspect a similar thing occurs for entering an incorrect
password; I have not tried this, though.

Anyway, thanks for your help, and you didn't write the programme after all.
Best regards,
Michael

Dear all,

We are currently taking the Qualitative Research course and for our final project we need to conduct two focus groups.
Groups will be conducted next week.

Monday April 28th (Eastern Europeans)
Tuesday April 29th (Western Europeans/US Americans)

We are comparing dating patterns of Eastern Europeans to Western Europeans/US Americans in a multicultural context.
We are also looking into impediments to cross-cultural relationships.
We are seeking female undergraduate students who come from these backgrounds (Western Europe and the United States, along with Eastern Europe).
Keep in mind, we will be conducting a focus group that will run for about 1 hour.
However please be assured that anything you say will be treated as confidential information.

For this we would like to ask you for your time and support.
If interested in helping us out, please respond to this message and we will organize suitable times to meet.

Stats credits will be given!

In case of any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact any of us..


Cheers,

Ciara, Lisa-Marlen, Shijia and Julia

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] HOUSING ALLOCATION: Another explanation of
==== email_text: 
Dear all,

With this e-mail, I will try to explain how college allocation works. Hopefully, this will help you understand why certain people were allocated certain colleges. This information is already included in the guidelines sent earlier, in even more detail. You are free to check that as well.

Each college has an upper threshold of 80% and a lower threshold of 60%. This means that no more than 80% of the returning students can be allocated a certain college and no less than 60%. The rest is for freshmen.

Some colleges were very close to the upper threshold already among the students that answered the form. Some were way below the lower threshold.

Now, not only must we make sure that no college goes above the upper threshold, we must also make sure that the colleges below 60% are brought up to the minimum number.

This year that meant that over half of the non-respondents had to be sent to a particular college.

We have received several e-mails from people who are not happy with their college allocation. None of these people filled in their preferences. We are currently compiling all the complaints.

Everybody who actually applied got their first preference.

In response to the e-mails which claim that we only spammed over two days, the first Housing allocation e-mail (with the guidelines) was sent on 11 April. If you will read the guidelines, you will also notice that the process happens over several phases, all of which must happen sequentially one after the other. This fact , and spring break in the middles of it all, severely limits the length of the phases.

We hope you will understand.

Gautam

Reasons to party on Wednesday the 30th of April

a) THURSDAY IS A HOLIDAY!! - Labour day!

b) Who doesn't want another party like the Nerd Party and shake it Nordmetall style ;)

c) Wednesday is HUMP DAY therefore why not shake off the stress that has built up during the previous two days of having to attend class

d) Most of our third year community would be celebrating the submission of their theses!!! Aaaaaand it would be rude not to celebrate with them and leave them hanging..? Our brothers from other mothers and sisters from other misters..? Drinking alone..?! NIEMALS!

e) Why not drink on Wednesday..? Its another day you get to rejoice as a student of a fully functioning Jacobs University Bremen!.. Hopefully..!

f) Many people everywhere in the world just gave life to more people! We should rejoice in the miracle of life!

ok.. if your still reading I got your attention!!

WEDNESDAY - 11 pm - Music Lab - Lets break it down ORIENTAL STYLE ;)

==== email_text: 
Dear all,

On Thursday, after the women's football tournament, there will be a small celebration for the players. During this, we want to show Jacobs in a good light so that they go away and  tell their friends good things about us. Therefore, we are looking for anyone who would like to perform at the celebration.

Maybe you performed at Dancestoned, Spotlight, Eid, Chinese New Year or African Heritage or one of the many other events on campus. Or do just want to showcase your talents to some visitors? If you are interested, please drop me a line and we can see if we can work something out. We already have some performers but want to show as many sides of Jacobs as we can to get some positive PR out there in Bremen and the surrounding areas.

Cheers,
Rob

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] GRADBALL WRISTBAND SALES
==== email_text: 
Dear Graduating Class,

Round 1 of Gradball wristband sales begin tomorrow at dinner tomorrow from 18-19:00 in the Mercator Servery. I will be there selling them. The other times will be 13-14:00 Wednesday, Friday, & Saturday in the Mercator Servery.. Round 1 allows each graduating student to purchase 3 wristbands ONLY (one for his/herself, and respective parents). Round 1 will end Saturday at 14:00.

There are two kinds of tickets you can buy:
-Gradball (dinner + party): 37=80 (pre-bought), 42=80 (at the door).
-Gradball (party only): 13=80 (pre-bought), 15=80 (at the door)

What is the difference?
-Gradball dinner and party, permits you to enter the Strandlust Hall at the beginning of the dinner, and you may stay until the end of the party at 7:00 the following day (June 7th).
-Gradball party, permits you to enter the Strandlust Hall ONLY AT 23:00 on June 6th when the party begins, you may stay until the end of the party at 7:00 the following day (June 7th).

What are the terms and conditions of the wristbands: (This is IMPORTANT)
-You cannot lose them! If you lose them you will have to buy a new one either from me or if sales have stopped on campus then you will have to buy at the door. NO EXCEPTIONS.
-Each wristband buys the food & drinks provided at your table and NOTHING ELSE (even from other (seemingly empty/unused) tables in the hall). If you take from an empty table you will have to pay for it individually. There is a bar where you can order drinks, but these drinks are not provided by the wristband, you must pay for them yourself.
-Strandlust prohibits the consumption of external beverages/ food on their premises. If you are caught your beverage/ food will be confiscated. You will not be compensated for this, as you have been fairly warned.

On behalf of the Graduation Committee 2014,
Lex Hassiak

==== subject: [nordmetall-students] GRADBALL WRISTBAND SALES
==== email_text: 
Dear Graduating Class,

Round 1 of Gradball wristband sales begin tomorrow at dinner today from 18-19:00 in the Mercator Servery. I will be there selling them. The other times will be 13-14:00 Wednesday, Friday, & Saturday in the Mercator Servery. Round 1 allows each graduating student to purchase 3 wristbands ONLY (one for his/herself, and respective parents). Round 1 will end Saturday at 14:00.

There are two kinds of tickets you can buy:
-Gradball (dinner + party): 37=80 (pre-bought), 42=80 (at the door).
-Gradball (party only): 13=80 (pre-bought), 15=80 (at the door)

What is the difference?
-Gradball dinner and party, permits you to enter the Strandlust Hall at the beginning of the dinner, and you may stay until the end of the party at 7:00 the following day (June 7th).
-Gradball party, permits you to enter the Strandlust Hall ONLY AT 23:00 on June 6th when the party begins, you may stay until the end of the party at 7:00 the following day (June 7th).

What are the terms and conditions of the wristbands: (This is IMPORTANT)
-You cannot lose them! If you lose them you will have to buy a new one either from me or if sales have stopped on campus then you will have to buy at the door. NO EXCEPTIONS.
-Each wristband buys the food & drinks provided at your table and NOTHING ELSE (even from other (seemingly empty/unused) tables in the hall). If you take from an empty table you will have to pay for it individually. There is a bar where you can order drinks, but these drinks are not provided by the wristband, you must pay for them yourself.
-Strandlust prohibits the consumption of external beverages/ food on their premises. If you are caught your beverage/ food will be confiscated. You will not be compensated for this, as you have been fairly warned.

On behalf of the Graduation Committee 2014,
Lex Hassiak

==== email_text: 
Dear students,

Professor Windt has invited you to a dialogue forum on Tuesday, May 6 from 14:30-15:15.

In order to enable as many students as possible to participate, teaching for all classes (except for second year lab courses) is officially cancelled from 14:15 - 15:30 hrs.  Second year lab courses in general take place as usual.

This extraordinary measure is taken because it is of importance that as many students as possible have the opportunity to be present. Hence, Professor Windt is looking forward to seeing you at the Dialogue Forum next week.

Best wishes,

Freia Hardt

Reasons to party on Wednesday the 30th of April

a) THURSDAY IS A HOLIDAY!! - Labour day!

b) Who doesn't want another party like the Nerd Party and shake it Nordmetall style ;)

c) Wednesday is HUMP DAY therefore why not shake off the stress that has built up during the previous two days of having to attend class

d) Most of our third year community would be celebrating the submission of their theses!!! Aaaaaand it would be rude not to celebrate with them and leave them hanging..? Our brothers from other mothers and sisters from other misters..? Drinking alone..?! NIEMALS!

e) Why not drink on Wednesday..? Its another day you get to rejoice as a student of a fully functioning Jacobs University Bremen!.. Hopefully..!
