Everyone is (of course) welcome to come watch and relax.\n\nAs I have pointed out in previous emails, this tournament is open for everyone of any skill level. We will show you how to throw and play.\n\nWe will divide into teams (5-6 per team) when we meet on the field at 11am (unless you made a team already). However, if you cannot make it that early, we'll put you in a team when you show up.\n\nAs this is a very weather-dependent event it is difficult to schedule games and say things for sure. However, we will play as long as there is interest.\n\nPlease note: as the signs on the field are indicating, you may not step on the grass. However, as this event is scheduled with CampusLife ahead of time, we may use it for this time period. So no frisbee (or anything else) on the field before the event or after the event.

He/she directly represents the student opinion of Bachelor and Master students. Other members of the AB are: the Provost, the 5 Deans, the Directors of the SES and SHSS and of the Academic Affairs Office, and the Young Scholar (representing PhD students and Staff).\n\nWhat does the Academic Board discuss?\nTopics include mainly program curricula, de-/installment of majors, decisions about hiring/replacement of teaching personnel, and decisions regarding academic policy. In the next academic year, the AB should also finalize constitutional changes and refine the tasks of certain positions and committees in the Academic Rules of Procedure.\n\nCurrently, I am the Young Learner but we will elect a new one before the summer break. If you think about candidating but have questions, you are welcome to approach me via email, phone (5381) or personally. I will also offer an information setting (time and location will be announced) soon.\n\nWhy should you become the YL?\nIf you are interested in developing the academic structures at Jacobs and if you would like to represent the student body, this is your opportunity. You will also be able to work together with the USG and GSA and get to know Jacobs' structures and politics much better.\n\nThink about it! :)\n\nBest,\nNadja\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Do you want to be part of academic decisions?"}, {"date": "Fri, 24 May 2013 18:01:16 +0200", "email_list": "Mercator <mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>, Nordmetall\n\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>, Krupp College\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>, College III\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "Sin Uk Kang <si.kang@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "*BOOKS: (15 euros for any one of them....negotiable)*\nSocial Research Methods                                  by Neuman\n\nEssential cell biology                                         by Alberts\net al.\nPrinciple of Biochemistry (4th Edition)                 by Nelson and Cox\n\nBiology -

Please think about how you used to be before comming here, and who you would be now if you would study at a different University. I am thankful for all the people that I've met here, not only my friends - because each interaction with somebody opens your eyes a bit more. I am so happy to notice that people here are not friends based on what clothes you wear, who are your parents and which clubs do you go. People here learn to look beyond the society-constructed labels. At least most of the people I've interacted with. I am grateful to have experienced  how warm and helpful people can be with each other when they are comfortable enough to take their masks off. And this is what happens each day here. You live in a big House, going to dinner you meet the other people, you see each other in the worst states -after a hangover at the Sunday brunch, in the IRC sleepless during exam period, at parties all dressed up- so you get comfortable and real.

I bet in a normal University, you'd get to meet only the socially adequate side of the people.. and that is by far not as refreshing as living in this place.\n\nWith this love in my heart, I want to wish you strength and good luck if you're still studying for your exams, and a wonderful Winter Vacation with lots of snow, Christmas movies, and Laughs!\n\nP.S.

They must inform the Instructor of Record before the beginning of the examination or class/lab session. The day after the excuse ends, students must contact the Instructor of Record in order to clarify the make-up procedure.\n\nIllness must be documented in writing by a qualified physician (the doctor=B4s note is called \"Arbeitsunf=E4higkeitsbescheiningung\"). Other emergencies must be appropriately documented in writing.\nAll such documentation must be placed on file in the Office of the Registrar by no later than the third calendar day from the beginning of illness/of the emergency.\nThese three days include the first day of the illness / of the emergency, i..e. if you are excused starting from 12.12., you should provide us the excuse by 14.12. at the latest to be officially excused from the Registrar's department.\nIf you submit a sick certificate after the deadline, an excuse may be issued, when applicable, only for the submission date and the two calendar days preceding it. Predated or backdated sick certificates - i.e., when the visit to the physician takes place outside of the documented sickness period - will be accepted only when the visit to the physician precedes or follows the period of illness by no more than one calendar day.\n\nOnly if these conditions are fulfilled you are given a chance for a make-up exam.\n\nFinally, kindly fulfill one last request which is very important:\nDo not forget to write the instructor's names on the note (not the courses).. Due to the strong accumulation of medical excuses that we receive without professor's names written on the note, these notes will not be processed prior until we get the needed information.\n\nMany thanks for your cooperation.\nI wish you good luck on your finals and a wonderful Christmas Break!\n\nKind regards,\nSavitri da Cruz\n", "subject": "[jacobs-students-announce] OFFICIAL Save this mail: What if sick?"}, {"date": "Fri, 13 Dec 2013 10:36:59 +0000", "email_list": "\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Klebe, Jessica Sandra\" <j.klebe@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Dear all,\n\nI am selling the Official IELTS Practice Material Volume 2.

If you are not in the city yet in January but are interested to join, please write back to me, so I can keep you updated!\n\n\nIf you are a passionate person who wants to do the work that matters to yourself and to the world, and would like to surround yourself with like-minded people, consider joining monthly meet-ups of the Live Your Legend LOCAL Bremen community. The first event will take place on January 7, at the global kick-off date of LYL LOCAL in 140+ cities in more than 40 countries. More (much more!) information and registration can be found at https://LYL-Bremen.eventbrite.com (note: the small registration fee is used to facilitate commitment, all revenue is reinvested into the events).\n\n\nTired of setting goals that don't excite you and trying to adopt habits that don't stick? Bored with life? Well, Danielle LaPorte says that when we set intentions, usually we do it because we believe that they will make us feel the certain way. In her Desire Map, she suggests to invert the process and start with defining our desired feelings, and using them as decision filters for our goals and daily activities.=20\nThe Desire Map Book Club Bremen (a part of the Biggest Book Club Ever with 600+ leaders worldwide!) will work through the Desire Map process in small groups through series of about five-six weekly meetings. At the end, you will learn your core desired feelings, have goals that set you on fire, and find new friends that are there to support you! First wave will start on January 11, registration is at https://DesireMap-Bremen.eventbrite.com (note: the book club is totally free! but you probably want to get your own copy of the book at Amazon / Thalia / Buch.de, or the ebook at daniellelaporte.com)\n\n\nAnd there is more to come!\n\nEnjoy the life! ;)\n\nAnatoliy,\non behalf of the (ghost of the) Personal Development Club\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Make the 2014 epic by surrounding yourself"}, {"date": "Sat, 28 Dec 2013 02:19:34 +0000", "email_list": "\"mercator-students@lists.jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<mercator-students@lists.jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Awan, Turrab Haider\" <t.awan@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Hello all,\n\nI seem to have misplaced my sleeveless H&M down jacket (not exactly sure where, but probably in either C3 or Mercator).

However, the idea behind it was really nice... different students (who probably normally don't cross paths often) with very different ethnic cooking backgrounds coming together to share recipes, food, and time together. I would like bring back the concept and to start a similar group, \"The Cupcake Club\", with the primary original focus being on different types of baked goods. The idea would be to get together maybe once a week, and to bake something together (maybe if people even like they can bring things to share that are already cooked:optional though), and have the opportunity to meet some new people, learn some new baking tricks, and eat yummy baked goods. Do not feel like you have to be some crazy type of culinary expert to join in, you just need to be friendly and like food.\n\nSo, that's basically the idea... but ideas die when no one else shares them, so I would like to have an idea if people would like to join something like this.

Nine people attended the event in Bremen, from whom four were from Jacobs, three living around Bremen and one person came from as afar as Emden (and he comes again to the second event)!\n\nOur next meeting in Bremen takes place on February 4 at 19:00!  More (much more!) information and registration can be found at https://LYL-Bremen.eventbrite.com.

The course is a bit difficult to find on Campusnet and every year students tell me \"I would have taken XY energy course if I had known\". I will request that the Registrar post the course in both the SES and SHSS course catalogues. Meanwhile, as I did for the Fall Semester energy courses, I am sending you this notification. As the course is an IES course, many of the topics covered are transdisciplinary-but the course is officially an SHSS course. For SES students, it may provide a relevant and interesting other school elective; for SHSS students, this course could be an opportunity to delve deeper into the social science/political aspects of energy relations and issues.\nBest regards, Karen Smith Stegen\n\nDescription: Course 040211, International Energy and Environmental Politics (Geopolitics). Instructor: Karen Smith Stegen\n\nBecause of the critical importance of energy to a state's stability and prosperity, energy-related strategies and foreign policy have historically been driven by a mixture of economic and political factors. In recent years, environmental policy - particularly pertaining to global warming - has begun to follow suit. In this course students will gain an understanding of the political dimension of energy and environmental matters through an examination of historical and contemporary examples of geopolitical jostling over energy supply (for example, Central Asia, Asia, Russia, the US, South America, Europe, and the Arctic) and by exploring topics such as energy security, nationalization, resource wars, and climate change. We will also assess the political implications of the shift to renewable energy: are political and energy security concerns likely to remain the same, increase or lessen?\n\n\n", "subject": "[jacobs-students-announce] OFFICIAL Spring Semester Energy Course:"}, {"date": "Sat, 1 Feb 2014 13:18:09 +0000", "email_list": "\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"jacobs-graduates@jacobs-university.de\"\t<jacobs-graduates@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Kiratli, Sevda Pinar\" <s.kiratli@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "and for that I need a few things:\n\ncan anyone lend me a mixer and/or a baking tin?\n\nThank you,\nSevda\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] I want cake!"}, {"date": "Sat, 1 Feb 2014 13:51:12 +0000", "email_list": "\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Limaj, Rrita\" <r.limaj@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "SGksDQoNCkkgYW0gc2VsbGluZyBteSBleHRlbnNpdmUgbm90ZXMgb24gdGhlIGNvdXJzZSBPcmdh\nbml6YXRpb24gd2l0aCBQcm9mLiBHdWlkbyBNw7ZsbGVyaW5nLg0KDQpUaGV5J3JlIHZlcnkgZGV0\nYWlsZWQgY2hhcHRlciBieSBjaGFwdGVyIHN1bW1hcmllcyBvZiB0aGUgY291cnNlIGJvb2sgYW5k\nIHdpbGwgYmUgaGVscGZ1bCBmb3IgdGhlIGZpbmFsIGV4YW0uDQoNClByaWNlOiAxMCBldXJvLg0K\nDQpSZXBseSBpZiB5b3UncmUgaW50ZXJlc3RlZC4NCg0KSHVnc2llcw0KUnJpdGENCg0K\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] SELLING Organization Notes!"}, {"date": "Sat, 1 Feb 2014 14:10:32 +0000", "email_list": "\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Ashraf, Faryal\" <f.ashraf@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Hello!\n\nI am selling books for mandatory GEM courses in Spring 2014:\n\n1.

The SHSS energy and environmental courses are a bit difficult to find on Campusnet and every year students tell me \"I would have taken XY energy course if I had known\". I will request that the Registrar post the course in both the SES and SHSS course catalogues. Meanwhile, as I did for the Fall Semester energy/environmental courses, I am sending you this notification. As the course is an IES course, many of the topics covered are transdisciplinary-but the course is officially an SHSS course. For SES students, it may provide a relevant and interesting other school elective; for SHSS students, this course could be an opportunity to delve deeper into the social science/political aspects of energy relations and issues.\nBest regards, Karen Smith Stegen\nDescription: Course 040211, International Energy and Environmental Politics (Geopolitics). Instructor: Karen Smith Stegen\n\nBecause of the critical importance of energy to a state's stability and prosperity, energy-related strategies and foreign policy have historically been driven by a mixture of economic and political factors. In recent years, environmental policy - particularly pertaining to global warming - has begun to follow suit. In this course students will gain an understanding of the political dimension of energy and environmental matters through an examination of historical and contemporary examples of geopolitical jostling over energy supply (for example, Central Asia, Asia, Russia, the US, South America, Europe, and the Arctic) and by exploring topics such as energy security, nationalization, resource wars, and climate change. We will also assess the political implications of the shift to renewable energy: are political and energy security concerns likely to remain the same, increase or lessen?\n\n\n", "subject": "[jacobs-students-announce] OFFICIAL Spring Semester Energy Course:"}, {"date": "Mon, 3 Feb 2014 16:23:27 +0000", "email_list": "Mercator <mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>, College III\n\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>, Krupp College\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>, Nordmetall\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Ivan, Ana\" <an.ivan@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Hey there, Jacobians!\n\nHaven't had a chance to buy the books for the SHSS classes that you have?

He/She shall be your partner for the evening. The random assignment will make sure that you get more experienced players mixing in with the less experienced players, making it more fair for everyone all around, and giving the beginners more opportunities to learn and improve their skill.\n\nThe more specific rules will be explained at the bar once we have everyone there, but the general idea would be to have the typical winners and losers brackets. Everyone starts at winners bracket and after the first loss goes down to the losers bracket, then the tournament proceeds with all players proceeding to play as normal. If you lose a second time in the losers bracket, you are withdrawn from the tournament, if you don't lose, you still have a chance to challenge the winner from the winners bracket and get first place.\n\nWinner will get a free beer!\n\nThis will be the first bar foosball event we have had and, if successful, we shall continue to have them maybe every other week or so, or even have other kinds of competitions (singles, doubles, mixed, etc.).\n\nIf you have never played before -- don't be afraid to try it out! DYP is open for all and is supposed to be fun, and the random assignment will make it more fair.\n\nIf you just want to go to the bar and hang out on a Wednesday (or simply to spectate) -- come by for a refreshing beverage, some music, and company!\n\nAnd if you want to get involved and participate in the event, reply back to me!

Students (also Jacobs students) receive a generous discount. Price: around 11 euros for two months. Sports include: box, bodystyling, salsa, muay-thai, yoga, streetdance, hockey, belly dance fusion and many many others. Check them here:\nhttp://www.buchsys.de/bremen/sportarten/aktueller_zeitraum/index.html\nCurrent classes will start on 10 February and will last until 30th of March. You can still register. \n\n2) If you like or would like to try sailing, try SUB:  http://www.sub-bremen.de  It is a sailing club, not related to Uni Bremen (except the name). You don't have to have experience, nor have a boat, nor be rich. Students pay around 10 euros per month. The club has a number of boats in Bremen, North sea or Baltic sea. Most people speak English (this is the default language in radio communications on sea). \n\n3) Have you tried horse riding? I don't mean sitting on a horse, while someone holds it. I mean trotting, galloping or even jumping, all by yourself. There are a number of horse riding clubs around Bremen. If you live in Bremen Nord, you should give a chance to Auetal e.V. http://www.rfgauetal.de There you can have up to three 30-Minutes riding lessons before you decide whether to join them. Each lesson costs around 13 euros. They also speak English. \n\n4) Also check regularly Cultural Center Lagerhaus in Viertel for theaters, concerts, special dance events, special movies or lectures:  http://kulturzentrum-lagerhaus.de/kultur\n\nHave fun!\n\nEugen\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Bubble is imaginary.

The Board has now informed me that these\nhypotheses were only the start of the plans for Jacobs. Unfortunately, a\nmember of the press spread a rumor that the hypotheses were not as\nextensive as they are.\n\nThis information -- is -- incorrect. The hypothesis on why Jacobs is\nfailing is because it lacks strategy, this is clear. The hypothesis of food\nis that food is important for survival, and a -- basic -- building block of\nlife. Mobility is important to --get-- around, very important for our\nfuture strategical choices. Diversity is a place, namely, not Jacobs. We're\ncurrently investing in several civil wars to increase the number of\ncountries and take advantage of this increased global diversity. The\nstrategies are strategic in order for future strategies to be fully\nstrategic in fulfilling overall strategic strategies, strategically.\n\nFurther hypotheses:\n\n*Idea 1: LIGHT*\n*Creating illuminated surfaces for global understanding.*\nLight is an important issue in all parts of the world where the sun sets.\nBremen, light, and Jacobs have an important inter-trans-disciplinarily to\ntheir coexistence. Research topics include:\n\n   - Building an institute of light, how it works and why\n   - Analysing lightbulbs and light fixtures throughout campus\n   - Implementing illuminated spaces (e.g classrooms, hallways)\n   - Creating useful discussions on tungsten vs. halogen\n\n*Idea 2: AIR*\n*Understanding the world-wide phenomenon of breathing*\nAir is the colourless gas we all love to breathe. Bremen's history with air\ndates back to prehistoric times, and remains a cornerstone of modern\nindustry and small medium business. Air is essential for the operation of\nnearly all Jacobs's services.\nExamples of research include:\n\n   - Developing \"air zones\" where air can be breathed inexpensively around\n   campus\n   - Understanding air as an art *and *a science\n   - Creating air institutes to study importance of air\n\n*Idea 3: Inspiration & Foreigners*\n*Finding connections and patterns where none exist*\nMany cultures, ethnic, religious, and foreign groups live on earth.\nInspiration inspires many inspirational foreigners to travel from a static\nto a dynamic state. Often movement is done inspirationally, from foreign\ncountry to foreign country.\nPossible research topics include:\n\n   - Explaining whether Africa is a country or a continent\n   - Identifying what the fox actually says\n   - Linking inspiration to foreigners and vice-versa\n\nIn next week's workshop, I want to listen to your ideas on these hypotheses\nand hear your answers to some of our most pressing questions.\n\nI am entirely convinced that next week workshops will be incentive needed\nto start the change process and will substantially contributes to its\nstrategic success.\n\nBest regards,\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] [jacobs-students-announce] Even Further"}, {"date": "Tue, 11 Feb 2014 21:19:11 +0000", "email_list": "mercator-students@lists.jacobs-university.de; collegeiii-students@jacob=\n", "sender": "collegeiii-students [collegeiii-students-bounces@lists.jacobs-univers=", "email_text": "\nHere's the link:  http://radioachtung.user.jacobs-university.de/fbapp/\n\npardon my incompetence\n\n\n", "subject": "[collegeiii-students] Radio on now!"}, {"date": "Tue, 11 Feb 2014 21:39:38 +0000", "email_list": "\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Nehlsen, Inga\" <i.nehlsen@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Hello lovely community :)\n\nDoes anyone know a good cobbler/shoe repairman/Schuster around here (Vegesack or Bremen)?\n\nThank you and sorry for the spam!\n\nInga\n\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] shoe repairman?"}, {"date": "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 01:50:40 +0100", "email_list": "<k.mbudu@jacobs-university.de>\n", "sender": "Kudakwashe Happy Muchandibaya <k.muchandibaya@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Hi\n\nIf you have any Shona Novel (preferably with a Traditional African \nSetting: Not the modernized ones), may you please lend it to me for a \nfew days?

These adjustments have been approved by the Academic Board and are as follows:\n\n\n=B7         Transcripts and certified copies of Jacobs documents: In the past, students could get 10 official transcripts for free and would pay 5 Euros for any additional copy. Certified copies of documents issued by Jacobs (e.g. certified copy of diploma or diploma supplement) , however, were issued for free. These services have now been combined. The new regulation is that overall (i.e. over all studies at Jacobs and for a combination of transcripts and certified copies), a total of 15 copies of transcripts and/or certified copies of documents issued by Jacobs are free of charge. For any additional document (transcript and/or certified copy of a document issued by Jacobs) students have to pay 5 Euros. This change is effective immediately..\n\n=B7         Re-Enrollment Fee: We have introduced a re-enrollment fee. This means that students who have been disenrolled by the university (e.g. due to missing health insurance payments, missing residence permit, etc.)  and right after the disenrollment solve their pending issues can be re-enrolled.. However, they will be charged a fee of 50 Euros. Note: This change will not apply to students who have been disenrolled due to missing enrollment requirements in the last four weeks.\n\n=B7         No other Registrar-related fees were changed.\n\nYou can find a summary of all administrative fees applying in the Registrar's Office at https://www.jacobs-university.de/registrar/fees.\n\nWith best wishes,\nUlrike Jeschke\nRegistrar\n", "subject": "[jacobs-students-announce] OFFICIAL OFFICIAL: Adjustment in"}, {"date": "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 09:16:13 +0000", "email_list": "\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"jacobs-graduates@jacobs-university.de\"\t<jacobs-graduates@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"John, Warren Andrew\" <w.john@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Dear All,\n\nWe will be having Christian Fellowship, starting today, on every Wednesday at 20.30 in the Student Activity Center (SAC/North Hall which is the building with the Pulse opposite Nordmetall) in Room 309.\n\nEveryone is invited! :)\n\nSorry for the spam and have a great day!\n\nKind Regards,\n\nWarren John\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Christian Fellowship Today"}, {"date": "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 09:44:06 +0000", "email_list": "\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Oral, Oguz\" <o.oral@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "As the title says, I am looking for an ipod classic.\n\nReply if you are selling one!\n\nOguz Oral\no.oral@jacobs-university.de<mailto:o.oral@jacobs-university.de>\nhttp://about.me/oguz.oral\n\n\n\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Buying an Ipod Classic"}, {"date": "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 10:39:30 +0000", "email_list": "\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Wiederkehr, Gabriela Patricia\" <g.wiederkehr@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "\n Hey!\n\n Is anyone selling the book: Public Policy: An Introduction to the Theory and Practice of Policy Analysis, by Wayne Parsons?\n\n If you are, please let me know :)\n\n Thanks,\n\n Gaby Wiederkehr\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Wayne Parsons"}, {"date": "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 11:56:47 +0000", "email_list": "\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Dreier, Patrick\" <p.dreier@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Dear All Spanish A1 - A2 takers,\n\nI have both Gente 1 Books (the textbook and the one you write in;

To stay in the spirit of this initiative (codename: Anti-Spam Awareness Campaign), THERE WILL BE NO EMAIL REMINDERS from my side.=20\n\n\nI had struggled a lot with the overwhelming amount of incoming internal emails at Jacobs.=20\n\nThinking of a bigger picture, it seems to me that people simply do not understand at all what happens after they click the send button on an email to a mailing list, people are not aware of how much time and energy of others they waste with EACH lengthy announcement (and sometimes they send as much as five emails in a single day!!! for several days!). At the same time, we have a lot of other ways of communication which are totally undervalued and underused by students (e.g. Jacobs main site and Teamwork), or a lot of possibilities to organize new ways (e.g. launching a forum platform with topic-focused sections - and I am not sure that it is not there yet, maybe it actually already exists!) that will allow people to get only the information they actually need and/or are interested in receiving, at the time they decide to devote to getting this information and not because they are forced to read everything.\n\nIn the end, I unsubscribed from jacobs-graduates list completely - but from that moment, I am totally unaware of things happening on campus and feel left out. I believe this is wrong. I believe there is another way, a much better way to organize our internal communications. I have been bearing different ideas to influence the change, and in my last full semester at Jacobs, I would like to act on them.=20\n\nI am also sure that the question concerns not only me, but many undergraduate students who feel forced to receive and process all the information flow (they start ignoring it and miss the information that is really important for them), and many graduate students who unsubscribe from a spammed list and feel left out, not involved, unwelcome in the community.\n\nDoing this project alone will not allow me to achieve the level of impact that is possible. Thus, I am asking for YOUR help.=20\n\nThis is an open call for people who would like to join in the initiative and execute this project. We will need all various types of people:=20\na person to coordinate the group,=20\na person to manage communications from our group to the student body, faculty and staff,=20\npeople who go there and talk with staff and students,=20\npeople who do the research around the direct and indirect costs of mass emails,=20\npeople who do the research about other ways of communications that are already available at Jacobs, as well as those that could be adopted,=20\npeople who present our findings,\npeople who write proposals,\ndesigners for posters and presentations,\nand everybody else who wants to contribute!!! Maybe you would like to produce a video? Maybe you would like to produce a big piece of art to communicate the vision? Just write back to me!\n\n\nMy first time estimates (everything is to be discussed and adjusted with the initiative group, Campus Life and IRC-IT):\nlaunch of the initiative: TODAY :)\nfirst meeting of the initiative group: around the end of the next week (Feb 20 - Feb 23, I will send a Doodle to the interested students);\nawareness-raising communications to students, faculty and staff at Jacobs: from March 1 until the end of the semester;\nhosting community-wide event around the end of April.\n\nThe purpose is to make a shift in the ways of approaching internal communication between students AND from the faculty and staff to students, such as everybody will feel involved and respected. All the materials produced by us will be passed on to Campus Life, IRC and IRC-IT to be used for educating all the future students around the topic, and published online for public access to serve as an inspiration to other communities who may struggle with the same issues. This is YOUR chance to shape the future of the internal communication at Jacobs.\n\nLet=92s stop wasting each other time. Let=92s stop overloading each other with unfocused, unwanted stuff.=20\n\nLet=92s make Jacobs a better place for us all!\n\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n- - - -\nLik Fenix (aka Anatoliy Antonov)=20\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] PLEASE READ & ACT NOW: Your chance to shape"}, {"date": "Fri, 14 Feb 2014 13:29:57 +0000", "email_list": "\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Baradyana, Immaculata Ishimwe Joseph\"", "email_text": "TADAAAAAAA....

Each jersey costs 36=80. It reduces to 32=80, if we get 20+ people.\n\nHowever, if we get 50 people, the price reduces to 27=80 each jersey.\n\nThe Ultimate Frisbee Club already aims for around 25 orders - all we need are 25 more orders and we can all share in the reduced price.\n\nCome to the SCC at 22:00 tonight and bring money and your hand (so you can sign the sheet)!\n\nConditions:\n\n1) He (Stefan) collects 36=80 from you.\n\n2) You sign the order list and tell him your size, preferred name and number on jersey, =85\n\n3) As soon as we have all the orders we can get, Campus Life and Stefan are going to order the jerseys.\n\n4) The jerseys arrive 2-4 weeks later and you can pick them up at the usual Ultimate Frisbee practice sessions or in Stefan's room.\n\n5) If we are 20+ or 50+ people, you get part of the money back! (i.e. 4=80 if we are 20+ and 9=80 if we are 50+ ... please understand, that for logistical reasons this is only possible afterwards and nobody can guarantee that we will in fact be 20+ or 50+ =85 it=92s just our common goal)\n\nMade your decision yet?\n\nWe hope to see you at 22:00 tonight at the entrance to the SCC (Sports and Convention Center),\n\nBest regards,\nB=E5rd, Stefan and other Jacobs Jersey enthusiasts\n\nPS: For the doubtful souls out there, here is the link.

This is part of an ongoing effort to automate and improve our services - we soon hope to launch an online Student Event Planning system as well.\n\nIn addition to developing such tools, and perhaps more importantly, it has become very apparent to us and many of you that we lack clear definition and transparency in terms of such issues as funding policies and deadlines for services. After much consideration and analysis of best practices gained over years of cumulative experience we have recently defined these to a large degree.\n\nIn short, we hope to move away from a reactionary culture of last-minute ad-hoc efforts and decision making to a pro-active and fair plan-ahead culture. Our goal is to plan at least a semester ahead for large-scale events and activities. The main reason for this is to reduce considerable stress and work for all concerned, not just staff but also student organizers and student assistants who make so many things happen around here. We have noticed that our current system is unhealthy for many of us either in terms of work-life balance or academic performance.\n\nWe realize that we cannot just enforce these new deadlines and policies overnight, and we are already in touch with the USG and GSA about how to collaboratively create and develop such a new culture over the course of the next semester/year and will adapt/amend these new policies and deadlines as we test them out together. We ask you for your support and welcome your input.. Please contact us and your USG/GSA members if you have any feedback/input to help us all succeed in this mission.\n\nTo see the policies as well as a revised Club Handbook please visit our Campus Life teamwork site: https://teamwork.jacobs-university.de:8443/confluence/display/CAIA/General+Info+and+Policies\n\n\nThanks for your support!\n\nBest,\nRen=E9 on behalf of the Campus Life team\n\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] New Campus Life Guidelines for Services and"}, {"date": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 17:21:59 +0000", "email_list": "\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Yan, Qifeng\" <q.yan@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Dear All,\n\nThere are still some vouchers unsold in Krupp in case the ones were sold out in your college.\nCome and get yours!\n\nHope to see you tomorrow,\nQifeng\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Chinese New Year vouchers sold out?"}, {"date": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 17:24:50 +0000", "email_list": "\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Wallin, Hannah Robin\" <h.wallin@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Dear Jacobs Students,\n\nWe are conducting a study focusing on fan identity here at Jacobs.\n\nWerder Bremen fans who are 18 or older are kindly invited to participate.

If\nyou are interested in entrepreneurship, start ups or direct hands on\napproach to starting a business, please read below for further information.\n\n\n*Jacobs Startup Lab 2014*\n\n\n*Aim*\n\nTo enable students to fast track their business idea to launch a start up.\n\n\n*Idea*\n\nThe idea is for individuals and team to work for the period of 1 or 2\nmonths on their start up. And in order to help them the seminars on team\nformation, idea generation, estimation of ideas worth, fund raising will be\ncarried out. At the end the team or the individual are expected to have\ndeveloped semi or fully finished product or service.\n\n\n*Description*\n\nThe program will run for the duration of 1 or 2 months and will include\nfollowing programs\n\n1.       Idea generation seminar\n\n2.       Workshops on how to build an idea to start up (From Jacobs alumni\n          working on their own startup)\n\n3.       Seminar on fund raising (VC, Crowd funding, Government funding,\n            business competitions)\n\n4.        Networking with fellow like minded entrepreneurs\n\n5.        Weekly work on their own start up and presentation of the\nprogress            made (if you wish this can be secret)\n\n6.       Team formation (you might have the idea but might not have found\n            right people)\n\n7.       Experience sharing from successfully failed start ups\n\n8.       And more\n\n\n*This will not include*\n\n\n1. This is not a competition. The main idea is to work on your own projects\nand get help from people who have already tried and tested their approach.\nSo you will have no direct monetary prize.\n\n\n2.NO Business plan...the idea is to try and fail in your work as many times\nas possible. Hands on approach is expected\n\n\n3.You start your own business and you retain the profit or loss incurred on\nyour own. Your ownership will not be transferred to anyone.\n\n\nIf you are interested in participating in such an event, please get back to\nme by Tuesday (25th February, 2014). If I find that sufficient numbers of\npeople are interested, I will initiate the process.

See you tonight! :)\n\n\n\nPositions are open for the following USG Co-Chair positions\n\nThe Academic Affairs Committee (AAC) is responsible for representing the interests of students in all aspects of university life relating to academics.. We work closely with staff and faculty in both the Office for Academic Affairs and the Undergraduate Education Committee (an all-university committee with representatives from faculty, staff and students), and seek to improve the quality of teaching learning at Jacobs University.\n\nThe Public Relations Committee (PRC) functions as a communication bridge between the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and the student body. We make sure that students are informed about the decisions made within the USG and the projects carried out by different committees; and bring students concerns and queries to the USG for discussion. We also have projects aimed at keeping students updated about important events and instances happening on campus.\n\nThe External Relations Committee (ERC) of the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) was created in 2010-2011 with the goal to establish, facilitate and uphold relations to organizations and institutions outside the Jacobs community. These relations are to be made with external organizations and institutions either independently, on behalf of students, or in coordination with other organizations or institutions. The ERC is also here to help existing relations of student-run organizations; however, it shall not intervene unnecessarily or unilaterally take over existing contacts between a Jacobs university student club and an external organization or institution. [Two positions are open for here, however one is a replacement position for half a semester and is only applicable to Krupp. The other full-year (spring-spring) position is open to all colleges].\n\nThe Internal Affairs committee (IAC) is concerned with the relations between Students and faculty, Students and admin, Students and students and Residential Colleges. We establish, facilitate and uphold relations with clubs and other internal institutions and help existing relations of student-run organizations. Please note this is a fall position that needs to be filled, and will have to be re-elected again in the fall. Only Students from Nordmetall may apply.\n\n\nPositions are open for the following USG Chair positions:\n\nThe Information Technology Committee (ITC) is responsible for digital and electronic information processing, the usage of current and future technologies and digital resources. It monitors the digital information acquisition, storage, access and exchange, ensures the availability and necessary functioning of all used technologies, the available digital resources and services, gives advice on the use of future technologies and manages the available student-run resources and services. The Committee accepts complaints concerning any of these areas and tries to react to them, if necessary.\n\n\nTwo replacement (half-year) positions are open for Student Court.\n\nStudent Court Judges interpret the constitution and by-laws of the USG as well as the community standards to resolve disputes thatmay arise on campus.\n\nTo apply please send a one page motivational statement (with a CV picture) tousg.secretariat@jacobs-university.de with the subject [Your college] USG Application for any of the chair positions.\nIf you are applying for Student Court please make out the email to the same address as above, but with the subject Student Court Application.\n\nThe application deadline is Sunday the 26th of February.\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] USG NEWS at 7pm in the serveries"}, {"date": "Mon, 24 Feb 2014 12:10:25 +0000", "email_list": "College III <collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>, Nordmetal\n\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>, Krupp\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>, Mercator\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"von Koslowski, Rebecca\" <r.vonkoslowski@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Hi guys!\n\nCould you please message me if you are taking French B1.1 (2) or B1.2(2)?\nI need to take one of the courses and have some quick questions.\n\nThank you so much and enjoy your day!\n\nRebecca\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] French B1.1 (2) or B1.2(2)"}, {"date": "Mon, 24 Feb 2014 12:19:51 +0000", "email_list": "\"von Koslowski, Rebecca\" <r.vonkoslowski@jacobs-university.de>, \"College\n", "sender": "\"Stein, Alina\" <a.stein@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "I take b 1.2\n\nGesendet mit meinem HTC\n\n", "subject": "Re: [nordmetall-students] [mercator-students] French B1.1 (2) or"}, {"date": "Mon, 24 Feb 2014 13:34:37 +0000", "email_list": "\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Wegmann, Siegfried Hoang Nguyen\" <s.wegmann@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "is on Wednesday 26th Feb.\n\nNOT SUNDAY\n\nSend yours to usg.secretariat@jacobs-university.de\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Deadline for USG applications"}, {"date": "Mon, 24 Feb 2014 13:35:15 +0000", "email_list": "\"jacobs-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<jacobs-students@jacobs-university.de>, \"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@lists.jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@lists.jacobs-university.de>,\t\"college-nordmetall@lists.jacobs-university.de\"\t<college-nordmetall@lists.jacobs-university.de>,\t\"jacobs-talk@jacobs-university.de\" <jacobs-talk@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Lapenna, Michele\" <m.lapenna@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "\n\nDear members of the Jacobs community,\n\n\n\nI received in the last days a couple of e-mails, asking me to hang up the tennis nets or the basketball hoops on the courts.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the Safety Regulations (Berufsgenossenschaft Bremen, the regulation for running outdoor courts at universities in Germany: =A7 2 BGV A1 i.V.m.

And we're going to bring you Sister Act an American film!\n\nBut wait, there's more. Last semester we had trouble figuring out when the best day and time was for our events. Although the people who came said they really enjoyed it, so few people were able to come. So this semester we've decided to outsource. We want you to tell us when the best day is for this event and what movies you would like to see.\n\nWhat this means is, I want you to tell me the best, funniest, etc. movie from your country (Especially if you're from a country in Africa). And, I want you to tell me what the best day is for us to host this event. There's just one tiny catch, Football fans have the MMR on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (I'm pretty sure) so that's automatically out of the question. Otherwise please tell me on which day if the event was held you would definitely come watch a movie with us here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nuiJuBo3kQNKeliTsHIKXQIPAhgL8XFfhDIRbJKZiv0/viewform\n\nkthxbai,\nChris\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] International Movie Night"}, {"date": "Mon, 24 Feb 2014 23:44:13 +0100", "email_list": "<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\n\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "Pulse Express <info@pulseexpress.com>", "email_text": "Dear all,\n\nDelight yourself with an Ipanema tonight by getting the Schweppes Ginger \nAle from Pulse now!\n\nIn case you need the recipe, watch (and like) the promotional video made \nby Pulse in collaboration with TOS on the Pulse Express facebook page.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152845818189068&set=vb.36455554067&type=2&theater\n\n\n\nAlso, don't forget about our limited-edition discounts: Christmas candy \nbag (400 g) for 3.00 and Pringles Ketchup for 2.50.

We work closely with staff and faculty in both the Office for Academic Affairs and the Undergraduate Education Committee (an all-university committee with representatives from faculty, staff and students), and seek to improve the quality of teaching learning at Jacobs University.\n\nThe Public Relations Committee (PRC) functions as a communication bridge between the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and the student body. We make sure that students are informed about the decisions made within the USG and the projects carried out by different committees; and bring students concerns and queries to the USG for discussion. We also have projects aimed at keeping students updated about important events and instances happening on campus.\n\nThe External Relations Committee (ERC) of the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) was created in 2010-2011 with the goal to establish, facilitate and uphold relations to organizations and institutions outside the Jacobs community. These relations are to be made with external organizations and institutions either independently, on behalf of students, or in coordination with other organizations or institutions. The ERC is also here to help existing relations of student-run organizations; however, it shall not intervene unnecessarily or unilaterally take over existing contacts between a Jacobs university student club and an external organization or institution. [Two positions are open for here, however one is a replacement position for half a semester and is only applicable to Krupp. The other full-year (spring-spring) position is open to all colleges].\n\nThe Internal Affairs committee (IAC) is concerned with the relations between Students and faculty, Students and admin, Students and students and Residential Colleges. We establish, facilitate and uphold relations with clubs and other internal institutions and help existing relations of student-run organizations. Please note this is a fall position that needs to be filled, and will have to be re-elected again in the fall. Only Students from Nordmetall may apply.\n\n\nPositions are open for the following USG Chair positions:\n\nThe Information Technology Committee (ITC) is responsible for digital and electronic information processing, the usage of current and future technologies and digital resources. It monitors the digital information acquisition, storage, access and exchange, ensures the availability and necessary functioning of all used technologies, the available digital resources and services, gives advice on the use of future technologies and manages the available student-run resources and services. The Committee accepts complaints concerning any of these areas and tries to react to them, if necessary.\n\n\nTwo replacement (half-year) positions are open for Student Court.\n\nStudent Court Judges interpret the constitution and by-laws of the USG as well as the community standards to resolve disputes thatmay arise on campus.\n\nTo apply please send a one page motivational statement (with a CV picture) tousg.secretariat@jacobs-university.de with the subject [Your college] USG Application for any of the chair positions.\nIf you are applying for Student Court please make out the email to the same address as above, but with the subject Student Court Application.\n\nThe application deadline is Wednesday the 26th of February.\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Because getting things done feels awesome!"}, {"date": "Mon, 24 Feb 2014 16:40:30 +0000", "email_list": "\"jacobs-students-announce@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<jacobs-students-announce@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"ses-graduates@jacobs-university.de\" <ses-graduates@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"Jacobs Graduate Students (shss-graduates@jacobs-university.de)\"\t<shss-graduates@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Hansen, Ulf\" <u.hansen@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Dear students,\n\nAmbassadors of East and South East Asia (including Australia) will visit Bremen on invitation of the \"Ostasiatischer Verein\" (OAV).\n\nOn Thursday, February 27th they will visit Jacobs University to strengthen the connections and interactions between Asia and Europe, a topic of high interest at our university.\n\nOAV and Jacobs University Bremen would like to invite you to be our guests for a programmatic speech on the topic\n\n\"Our way to Asia - how Jacobs University builds bridges \"\nby\nProf. Dr.-Ing.

Exact\nperformance dates depend on weather, of course. The One-Act Festival itself\nis schedule for 12-17 May, so we'll aim to perform around that time.\n\nReply if interested in *acting or writing*! I want to make this a\nNordmetall tradition!\n\nIn our first meeting (time TBA) we'll discuss what kind of play to do\n(naturally I have a proposal and script of my own but as I said I want to\nmake this a NM tradition) and work out a story.

Yet some scholars now argue that trust is lower when we are surrounded by people who are different from us. I challenge this view and argue that residential segregation, rather than diversity, leads to lower levels of trust. Integrated and diverse neighborhoods will lead to higher levels of trust, but only if people also have diverse social networks. I examine the theoretical and measurement differences between segregation and diversity and summarizes results on how integrated neighborhoods with diverse social networks increase trust in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia. I also show how different immigration and integration policies toward minorities shape both social ties and trust.\n\nEverybody is welcome - we look forward to seeing you!\n\nBest wishes,\nFranziska Deutsch\n\nDr. Franziska Deutsch\nUniversity Lecturer & Field Coordinator\nJacobs University Bremen & BIGSSS\nCampus Ring 1\n28759 Bremen\n\nOffice: South Hall, room 314\nPhone: +49 421 200 3958\nFax: + 49 421 200 3955\nf.deutsch@jacobs-university.de\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] This Wednesday: BIGSSS Colloquium with Eric"}, {"date": "Tue, 4 Mar 2014 15:11:39 +0000", "email_list": "\"nordmetall-students@lists.jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<nordmetall-students@lists.jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Neumann, Franziska\" <f.neumann@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Hey guys!\n\nDoes everyone have the book 'L'=C9tranger' by Albert Camus (original in French)?\nThank you in advance!

Yet some scholars now argue that trust is lower when we are surrounded by people who are different from us. I challenge this view and argue that residential segregation, rather than diversity, leads to lower levels of trust. Integrated and diverse neighborhoods will lead to higher levels of trust, but only if people also have diverse social networks. I examine the theoretical and measurement differences between segregation and diversity and summarizes results on how integrated neighborhoods with diverse social networks increase trust in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia. I also show how different immigration and integration policies toward minorities shape both social ties and trust.\n\nEverybody is welcome - we look forward to seeing you!\n\nBest wishes,\nFranziska Deutsch\n\nDr. Franziska Deutsch\nUniversity Lecturer & Field Coordinator\nJacobs University Bremen & BIGSSS\nCampus Ring 1\n28759 Bremen\n\nOffice: South Hall, room 314\nPhone: +49 421 200 3958\nFax: + 49 421 200 3955\nf.deutsch@jacobs-university.de\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Today: BIGSSS Colloquium with Eric Uslaner"}, {"date": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 14:16:27 +0000", "email_list": "\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Swiderska, Aleksandra\" <a.swiderska@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Dear All,\n\nWe are looking for participants for a super short (and fun, we think) 15-minute study in Lab III.\nThe study focuses on decision making in a bargaining game.\n\nAs compensation, you can receive up to 3,4 euro.\n\nIf you are interested, please get back to me to schedule an appointment.\n*Feel free to let me know what time would work for you tomorrow or on Friday between 9 am and 6 pm.\n\nBest,\nAleksandra\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Research participants needed: Earn up to 3,"}, {"date": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 15:56:55 +0000", "email_list": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Pa=DFlick=2C_Luisa_Franziska?=\n\t<l.passlick@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@lists.jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@lists.jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@lists.jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@lists.jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@lists.jacobs-university.de\"\t<krupp-students@lists.jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@lists.jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@lists.jacobs-university.de>,\t\"jacobs-graduates@jacobs-university.de\"\t<jacobs-graduates@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Thapa, Annu\" <a.thapa@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI lost my keys either in Jacobs or in the way to USG water excursion today...\nIf anyone happens to find it please please please let me know as soon as possible....\n\nMy key has the tag of my room i.e. KA-112.\n\nRegards,\nAnnu Thapa\n\n+49 157 38726993.\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Please save me!!!!!"}, {"date": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 16:18:55 +0000", "email_list": "\"KC, Tilak\" <t.kc@jacobs-university.de>\n", "sender": "\"Kvatashidze, Iakob\" <i.kvatashidze@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Q29uZ3JhdHVsYXRpb25zIGFuZCBnb29kIGx1Y2shIDopDQoNCkJ1dCB3aHkgNjggYW5kIG5vdCA2\nOSBzdG9yaWVzPw0KOikpKSkNCkl0IHdvdWxkIGJlIGludHJpZ3VpbmcuIDspDQoNCkhhaGEgOikp\nDQoNCg0KDQpTZW50IGZyb20gbXkgaVBob25lDQoNCk9uIDUg4YOb4YOQ4YOgLCAyMDE0LCBhdCAx\nNToxNywgIlRpbGFrIEtDIiA8dC5rY0BqYWNvYnMtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS5kZTxtYWlsdG86dC5rY0Bq\nYWNvYnMtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS5kZT4+IHdyb3RlOg0KDQpEZWFyIGZlbGxvdyBKYWNvYmlhbnMsDQoN\nCk15IHNob3J0IHN0b3J5IGNvbGxlY3Rpb24gIjY4IFN0b3JpZXMiIGlzIG91dC4gSWYgeW91IGFy\nZSBpbnRlcmVzdGVkIGluIGhhdmluZyBhIGNvcHkgaXQgaXMgYXZhaWxhYmxlIGluIGFtYXpvbi4N\nCg0KDQpEZXNjcmlwdGlvbjoNCg0KNjggU3Rvcmllc+KAnSBpcyB0aGUgY29sbGVjdGlvbiBvZiB2\nZXJ5IHNob3J0IHN0b3JpZXMsIGRheSB0byBkYXkgYW5lY2RvdGVzIGFuZCBtdXNpbmdzIHVwb24g\ndGhlIGxpZmUuVGhlIHN0b3JpZXMgcmVmbGVjdCBteSBwZXJjZXB0aW9uIG9mIHJlYWxpdHkgd2hp\nbGUgZ3Jvd2luZyB1cCBhcyB3ZWxsIGFzIG15IHN0cnVnZ2xlIHdpdGggbGlmZS4gVGhlIHNob3J0\nIHN0b3J5IGNvbGxlY3Rpb24gaXMgbm93IGF2YWlsYWJsZSBvbiBhbWF6b24gb24gcHJpbnQgYW5k\nIGtpbmRsZSAoZWJvb2spIHZlcnNpb24uIEZvbGxvd2luZyBhcmUgdGhlIGRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbiBj\naGFubmVscy4NCg0KRm9yIG1vcmUgaW5mb3JtYXRpb246IGh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGlsYWtrYy5jb20v\nNjgtc3Rvcmllcy8NCg0KDQpUaGFuayB5b3UgdmVyeSBtdWNoIGZvciB5b3VyIHRpbWUuDQoNCllv\ndXJzIFNpbmNlcmVseSwNClRpbGFrDQoNCi0tDQpDbGFzcyBvZiAyMDE0LCBNU2MuIEludGVybmF0\naW9uYWwgTG9naXN0aWNzDQpQcmVzaWRlbnQsIEdyYWR1YXRlIFN0dWRlbnQgQXNzb2NpYXRpb24N\nCjw2OF9TdG9yaWVzLmpwZz4NCl9fX19fX19fX19fX19fX19fX19fX19fX19fX19fX19fX19fX19f\nX19fX19fX19fDQpub3JkbWV0YWxsLXN0dWRlbnRzIG1haWxpbmcgbGlzdA0Kbm9yZG1ldGFsbC1z\ndHVkZW50c0BsaXN0cy5qYWNvYnMtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS5kZTxtYWlsdG86bm9yZG1ldGFsbC1zdHVk\nZW50c0BsaXN0cy5qYWNvYnMtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS5kZT4NCmh0dHA6Ly9saXN0cy5qYWNvYnMtdW5p\ndmVyc2l0eS5kZS9tYWlsbWFuL2xpc3RpbmZvL25vcmRtZXRhbGwtc3R1ZGVudHMNCg=\n", "subject": "Re: [nordmetall-students] My short story collection 68 Stories"}, {"date": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 17:20:51 +0000", "email_list": "\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Toma, Catalin Eugen\" <c.toma@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Math Support Center- today from 20:00 in Mercator QSA\n\nBest,\nCatalin\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] MSC -

You can find detailed information here: http://www.jacobs-university.de/career-services/internship_funding .\n\nPLEASE NOTE: CSC does not have any additional programs for financial support of students besides those mentioned at our Internship Funding website.\nCSC does not guarantee any student a financial support for her/his internship. All decisions for internship funding are done within a clear application process and have very limited funds. Therefore, we recommend our students to search for compensated internships in order to secure their income for living expenses during the internship. If any additional support programs will be offered in future, CSC will inform all students and update the given website accordingly.\n\nIMPORTANT: CSC will hold an additional Internship Information Session next Tuesday, March 11th 2014; 12:30-14:00 in ICC Conference Room, for which you already received an invitation email. Please register here: http://www.eventbrite.de/e/internship-information-session-tickets-10831602615 .

Yesterday, when I came to the sports\nhall my co-members and I were notified by the porter on duty that it is no\nlonger allowed for our club to use the sports hall. As evidence he showed us\na printed e-mail from Michele Lapenna to the campus security office (the\nporters) stating that from Friday the 14th onwards he should not let the\nindoor football club, the hockey club or the cricket club into the sports\nhall. Since the club leaders hadn't received an e-mail from Mr. Lapenna we\nwere obviously surprised.\n\n \n\nAfter asking the porter whether we could go in anyway and after he declined\nwe tried to think of a reason for this situation. The club had been\nregistered on the campus life website and the attendance list for February\nhad been sent on time. The goals had always been returned to their\nrespectable place, there were no dirty shoes and the doors had always been\nclosed properly.\n\n \n\nIt could also not be the club fees. The club leaders had already decided not\nto take one. Since they took one last semester they thought that was enough\nto ask from the members. And I agree - the fees collected last semester are\nenough to get more materials if needed. Why would they then ask the members\nfor more?\n\n \n\nAll together I am not very surprised though. This whole situation is just\nanother story added to the long list of questionable things happening to\nsports teams and clubs on this campus. Whether it is the rugby team being\nexpected to get to their tournament in a porter van that is not certified to\nleave campus, or the football team not being able to practice because of an\narbitrary booking system, or the female football team not being able to\nattend their own guest practice - all these situations were entirely\nunnecessary.\n\nI saw in the practice times that the hockey team and the cricket team must\nhave encountered the same problem. Do you know why we can't get in? And does\nanyone know why this keeps happening?\n\n \n\n#SOSIndoorFootball #ImYourVoiceIndoorFootball\n\n \n\nIn the hope to play indoor football again soon and on behalf of the indoor\nfootball club,\n\n \n\n \n\nTom Suberg\n\n \n\n \n\nPS.: Please keep in mind that this is an e-mail sent by the whole indoor\nfootball club and not by me as a person.\n\n\nBSc International Logistics Management & Engineering 2014 \n\n \n\nJacobs University Bremen\n\nCampus Ring 7 \n28759 | Bremen | Germany\n\n \n\nMobile: +491782872587\n\n \n\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Why does this keep happening?"}, {"date": "Mon, 17 Mar 2014 08:44:14 +0000", "email_list": "\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Mah, Liane Cecin\" <l.mah@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "[https://exchange.jacobs-university.de/owa/attachment.ashx?id=3DRgAAAACroZFCiQX%2fTZoslVGch5yzBwAPdfTdYH4pQrQ6aUPEFW6XAAAANDIRAAAPdfTdYH4pQrQ6aUPEFW6XAAAAXkALAAAJ&attcnt=3D1&attid0=3DEAC7%2fbC0a0gpTrZwSPJueyrx&attcid0=3Dd75000b9-27e3-b288-5ab0-d9dd90102f69]\n\nInterested in yoga?\nWhen: Tuesday 7:45-8:45AM\nWhere: C3's Collegemaster Apartment\n\nDue to space restriction, only limited spots are available.\nPlease sign up by replying to this email (first come, first serve).\n Sign-ups are binding!\n(Please ensure that you can come before signing up)\n\n\nPlease wear comfortable clothing and bring a towel (and mat if you have your own).\n\nNamaste.\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Morning Yoga Tomorrow"}, {"date": "Mon, 17 Mar 2014 08:48:40 +0000", "email_list": "collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de; krupp-students@jacobs-univers=\n", "sender": "collegeiii-students [collegeiii-students-bounces@lists.jacobs-univers=", "email_text": "Dear Tom, the Indoor Football Team, and any other clubs involved in this,\n\nFirst off, I am sorry to hear that this happened.

Since four people dropped out, we now have 4 more spots open. So reply quickly. Also you would have to transfer the money by Friday either to my account or give it to me in person, further information on that will follow once we have filled up the four spots. SO find below again all the information:\n\nI am happy to inform you that Prof. Ress is offering an excursion to Strasbourg from the 5th of May to the 7th of May 2014.\n\nOn the excursion we will visit a hearing in the European Court of Human Rights (I attached the case we are going to hear), we will also visit the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. In Strasbourg we will go on a boat tour around the city and have a guided tour in the cathedral of Strasbourg.\n\nMost of the costs will be covered. You will only need to pay around 40=80 for the whole trip. This includes all costs for the accommodation in Kehl (German city right next to Strasbourg), breakfast, the transport by bus, the visits of the different sights in Strasbourg and dinner on the first evening (basically all costs, despite the lunch and dinner on the second and third day).\n\nWe will leave from Jacobs University very early in the morning on the 5th of May around 3-4am (the exact time will be announced soon) and come back to campus on the 7th of May around midnight.=20\n\nWe can take only a limited number of students to Strasbourg. Right now there are 4 places left. So, if you would like to join this excursion, write me an e-mail in which you bindingly state that you want to join the excursion. We will accept registrations on a first-come-first-serve-basis. We will give you the exact information about the costs and the time of departure as soon as possible.\n\nFor further questions, please email me\n\nBest,\n\nLisa\n\nLisa Anouk M=FCller-Dormann\nl.muellerdormmann@jacobs-university.de\n\nJacobs University Bremen\nInternational Politics and History\nClass of 2014\n\nTA Prof. Dr. Dr. Ress\nTA Dr. Odag\n\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Strasbourg excursion, 4 last spots"}, {"date": "Wed, 19 Mar 2014 20:44:19 +0100", "email_list": "<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\n\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Lisa_Anouk_M=FCller-Dormann?=", "email_text": "Best,\n\nLisa Anouk M=FCller-Dormann\nl.muellerdormmann@jacobs-university.de\n\nJacobs University Bremen\nInternational Politics and History\nClass of 2014\n\nTA Prof. Dr. Dr. Ress\nTA Dr. Odag\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] all spots taken"}, {"date": "Wed, 19 Mar 2014 20:49:42 +0000", "email_list": "\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Kuzmanovski, Stefan\" <s.kuzmanovski@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Q09NRSBUTyBUSEUgQ09MTEVHRSBPRkZJQ0UgVE8gT1JERVIgWU9VUiBIT09ESUUhISEgWU9VIENB\nTiBBTFNPIFBBWSBJRiBZT1UgV0FOVCwgVEFOSkEgV0lMTCBHSVZFIFlPVSBBIFJFQ0VJUFQgTEFU\nRVIgT04uDQoNCk9uIE1hciAxNywgMjAxNCA3OjAxIFBNLCAiUnVwYXNpbmdoZSwgTWVuZWthIFJ1\ndmkiIDxtLnJ1cGFzaW5naGVAamFjb2JzLXVuaXZlcnNpdHkuZGU+IHdyb3RlOg0KDQoNCkRFQURM\nSU5FICBmb3Igb3JkZXJpbmcgdGhlIEhvb2RpZXMgaXMgdGhlIDI0dGggb2YgTWFyYyEgOkQNCg0K\nDQpMZXQncyByb2NrIHRoaXMgY2FtcHVzLA0KDQpOb3JkaWUgU3R5bGUhIDspDQoNCltjaWQ6aW1h\nZ2UwMDEuanBnQDAxQ0YzRjk3LjA0NTdBQ0EwXQ0KDQo\n", "subject": "Re: [nordmetall-students] College Office open"}, {"date": "Wed, 19 Mar 2014 21:58:51 +0100", "email_list": "<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\n\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "Pulse Express <info@pulseexpress.com>", "email_text": "Hello everyone,\n\nIf you have coins you would like to turn into cash please drop by Pulse \nand let us make you happy! :)\n\nOn behalf of the Pulse Express,\nSelin\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Pulse Wants Your Coins!"}, {"date": "Wed, 19 Mar 2014 22:26:02 +0000", "email_list": "\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Wu, Suizhi\" <s.wu@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Hello Jacobs Undergrad Community,\n\nThe USG would like to extend its invitation to attend our meetings to you.

I can only urge you to maintain your patience. But of course, that is your choice.\n\nBut I disagree with the point that is is unfair to the students who wish to have more than one guest at the ceremony.  I believe that:\n1) whether a ticket is available for an individual or not does not necessarily facilitate or hinder said person from purchasing plane tickets or booking hotels. It only dictates whether they can enter the SCC for the approximately 3 hours that the ceremony takes place. It doesn't stop them from celebrating with the graduate after the ceremony or attending the Grad-Ball.\n\nBut,\n2) if the individual only wishes to come to Bremen if they can sit in the SCC for the ceremony, then I guess it is unfair, because then they won't book their flights or hotels until this decision regarding how the unused tickets will be distributed is made and the price for the flight or hotel may be much more expensive by then.\n\nIf you are one of these people who considers it unfair, as stated in option 2 and cannot be patient, then please, by all means, buy Grad Ceremony tickets that people choose to sell because they don't need them, and risk having this ticket you purchased be invalid at the actual ceremony as well as spending considerably more money for a ticket than you would have to if you were patient.\n\nSorry that this email may not have the new many of you had been hoping for, but if you can just bear with us for another week or two, the final decision will be made and we will inform you immediately. If you cannot, please see advice provided in blue text.\n\nOn behalf of the Graduation Committee 2014,\nLex Hassiak\n\n\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] Update on Grad-Ceremony Tickets.."}, {"date": "Tue, 1 Apr 2014 13:20:03 +0000", "email_list": "\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Wiederkehr, Gabriela Patricia\" <g.wiederkehr@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "\n Hello everyone,\n\n I am interested in establishing contact with GEM students and alumni that have had a working experience and could give me some feedback.

The policies have been expanded so that we will now also accept transfer credits from language courses which are not offered at Jacobs (with the exception of English) which have been issued by our partner universities. Partner universities run a student exchange program with Jacobs University based on a legally binding contract regulating all procedures for a student exchange.\n\nThe expanded policy allows students who go abroad to one of Jacobs' partner universities to choose a language course of their choice, for example in the native language of their host country, and receive transfer credits. The university will thus foster language learning and strengthen existing partner programs at the same time.\n\nPlease note that all transfer credits need to be approved prior to a stay abroad.\n\nSee the full policy here: http://www.jacobs-university.de/policies\n\nBest regards\nDorothee Groeger\n\n", "subject": "[jacobs-students-announce] OFFICIAL New: Expanded Language Course"}, {"date": "Thu, 10 Apr 2014 07:14:00 +0000", "email_list": "\"mercator-students@lists.jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<mercator-students@lists.jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?De_Sutter=2C_Fran=E7oise_Emiel?=", "email_text": "Dear All,\n\nMarlou and I are very excited to announce that the positions for O-Week 2014 Student Advisors are now open!\n\nBefore applying we ask that you please read the description and requirements for student advisors carefully.\n\nWho are Student Advisors?\nStudent Advisors will be in charge of helping out freshmen integrating into the community, on and off campus.

In Germany there are very strict laws regarding food and the sale of food that are meant to protect consumers, producers, and small and large merchant companies. However, this often results in good food being thrown away for no reason.\nUnfortunately, all the websites I have found are in German - if someone could find that in English, it would probably be better.\nBasically, there is the Tafel in general (http://www.tafel.de <http://www.tafel.de/die-tafeln/tafel-suche.html> ) and in Bremen specifically (http://www.bremertafel.de/frames.htm) who might take food donations. However, they generally only take food directly from the supermarkets that is close to expiration date. I doubt they would be willing to take food from a catering service - again: food regulations.\nFYI:\nBecause many people in Germany do not agree with the wasteful food regulations, communities have established themselves around the principle of \"Containern\" or \"Dumpstern\". (See: http://www.dumpstern.de/was-ist-dumpstern/ .) This means that people will go to the containers near a supermarket and take the unopened and still perfectly fine food from the trash and eat that. In fact, this is how most people who cannot afford food and quite a sizable number of university students at get their food. Both activists as well as people who just can't afford it do this. However, this is ILLEGAL. Some big chains of supermarkets have even installed cameras just for that reason. (Though it's unlikely you get into real trouble even if caught.)\n\nOn the whole, I agree that this is a very serious issue, but I doubt that it would help anything if the USG would get involved in this. There are other ways to get active. Due to the food regulations here in Germany, it is very unlikely that the surplus from Apetito would be accepted anywhere.\n\nBest,\nLydia\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] (VIP) SAD OBSERVATION !"}, {"date": "Wed, 16 Apr 2014 07:36:44 +0000", "email_list": "\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\n\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"krupp-students@jacobs-university.de\" <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Hauru, Aila Onerva\" <a.hauru@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Are you experienced in organizing events?

Hopefully, this will help you understand why certain people were allocated certain colleges. This information is already included in the guidelines sent earlier, in even more detail. You are free to check that as well.\n\nEach college has an upper threshold of 80% and a lower threshold of 60%. This means that no more than 80% of the returning students can be allocated a certain college and no less than 60%. The rest is for freshmen.\n\nSome colleges were very close to the upper threshold already among the students that answered the form. Some were way below the lower threshold.\n\nNow, not only must we make sure that no college goes above the upper threshold, we must also make sure that the colleges below 60% are brought up to the minimum number.\n\nThis year that meant that over half of the non-respondents had to be sent to a particular college.\n\nWe have received several e-mails from people who are not happy with their college allocation. None of these people filled in their preferences. We are currently compiling all the complaints.\n\nEverybody who actually applied got their first preference.\n\nIn response to the e-mails which claim that we only spammed over two days, the first Housing allocation e-mail (with the guidelines) was sent on 11 April. If you will read the guidelines, you will also notice that the process happens over several phases, all of which must happen sequentially one after the other. This fact , and spring break in the middles of it all, severely limits the length of the phases.\n\nWe hope you will understand.\n\nGautam\n(On behalf of the Room Allocation Committee)\n\n\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] HOUSING ALLOCATION: Another explanation of"}, {"date": "Sun, 27 Apr 2014 11:28:48 +0000", "email_list": "Krupp College <krupp-students@jacobs-university.de>,\n\t\"mercator-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<mercator-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<nordmetall-students@jacobs-university.de>,\t\"collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de\"\t<collegeiii-students@jacobs-university.de>", "sender": "\"Reitz, Sarah Kim\" <s.reitz@jacobs-university.de>", "email_text": "Dear all,\n\nI am too looking for one more graduation ticket for my little sister :)\nIf you have one that you do not need, please get back to me.\n\nThank you and sorry to everyone who has to bear with all these graduation spams.\n\nEnjoy your Sunday!\nSarah\n\n", "subject": "[nordmetall-students] One more graduation ticket?

NO EXCEPTIONS.\n-Each wristband buys the food & drinks provided at your table and NOTHING ELSE (even from other (seemingly empty/unused) tables in the hall). If you take from an empty table you will have to pay for it individually. There is a bar where you can order drinks, but these drinks are not provided by the wristband, you must pay for them yourself.\n-Strandlust prohibits the consumption of external beverages/ food on their premises. If you are caught your beverage/ food will be confiscated.
